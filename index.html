The well-written text and excellent illustrations emphasize three essential themes to demonstrate the major roles of the discipline -- Geography as Physical Science, Geography as Spatial Science, and Geography as Environmental Science. With a strong focus on processes and the interrelationships among Earth&#39;s systems, this text guides you to an understanding and appreciation of how the various natural systems function and of how humans are an integral component of physical geography. Historically, this was the first Physical Geography textbook to take an environmental sustainability approach, and the authors continue to address the theme of human interactions with the environment.</p><p>James F.

This history of the railroad records the story of the C&amp;S and of the men who managed it during wartime.</p><p>"Vital Rails is an excellent study that expertly connects the importance of the Charleston &amp; Savannah Railroad to the Confederacy's overall war effort. Rich with detailed information, maps, and images, Stone's book is a must-read for all those interested in truly understanding the crucial logistical and military operations in the South Carolina lowcountry during the Civil War."--Stephen R. Wise, curator, Parris Island Museum, and author of Gate of Hell: Campaign for Charleston Harbor, 1863 <p>"H. David Stone breaks new ground in his thoughtful study of the Charleston &amp; Savannah Railroad. The C&amp;S's conception, construction, Civil War operations, and economic collapse at the end of the war describe in microcosm antebellum southern railroad development. The Confederate defense of the railroad against Union raiders offers new insights into this nearly forgotten aspect of the Civil War. A well-researched history, Vital Rails should attract the interest of economic, military, railroad, and southern historians as well as those interested in the histories of Charleston and Savannah."--John E.

Conceptions of the Human Condition (Paradigm)</h2><p>Reflecting the decline in college courses on Western Civilization, Marshall Sahlins aims to accelerate the trend by reducing &#34;Western Civ&#34; to about two hours. He cites Nietzsche to the effect that deep issues are like cold baths; one should get into and out of them as quickly as possible. The deep issue here is the ancient Western specter of a presocial and antisocial human nature: a supposedly innate self-interest that is represented in our native folklore as the basis or nemesis of cultural order. Yet these Western notions of nature and culture ignore the one truly universal character of human sociality: namely, symbolically constructed kinship relations. Kinsmen are members of one another: they live each other&#39;s lives and die each other&#39;s deaths. But where the existence of the other is thus incorporated in the being of the self, neither interest, nor agency or even experience is an individual fact, let alone an egoistic disposition. &#34;Sorry, beg your pardon,&#34; Sahlins concludes, Western society has been built on a perverse and mistaken idea of human nature.</p><p><b>Marshall Sahlins</b> is the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Chicago. He is the author of many books.&nbsp;<p>"In this latest in a series of contentious&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;pamphlets, really, distinguished anthropologist Marshall Sahlins (who is also executive publisher of this series) opposes the Western idea of human nature (at least its Hobbesian branch) as avaricious, pugnacious and destructive, unless severely governed. He cites earlier and non-Western societies in which this view is by no means prevalent. Think, he says, of the many societies in which beasts are considered substantially human rather than humans being substantially beasts."</p> (Martin Levin <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> 2008-07-26)</p><h2>Job (Ignatius Catholic Study Bible)</h2><p><p>The 18th volume in the popular Bible study series leads readers through a penetrating study of the Book of Job using the biblical text itself and the Church's own guidelines for understanding the Bible.</p><p>Ample notes accompany each page, providing fresh insights by renowned Bible teachers Scott Hahn and Curtis Mitch, as well as time-tested interpretations from the Fathers of the Church.

He is Associate Clinical Professor of Psychology in the Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis at New York University, and a Senior Member of the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis. He is the author of a number of books, including <i>Toxic Nourishment, The Psychoanalytic Mystic, Feeling Matters</i> and <i>Flames from the Unconscious</i>.&#39;Eigen is one of the dozen or so most interesting psychoanalysts writing today. The Electrified Tightrope presents him in his familiar function as scholar-healer; his speciality: the construction and reconstruction of the breathing, seeing, moving, electric, and, yes, electrifying self. For the mental health practitioner, what Eigen presents are a hundred points of entry. What may seem in our work dim, dismal, even worrisomely &#34;disruptive moments&#34; are show by him to be &#34;necessary steps&#34; in the &#34;profound process by ego repair or formation&#34;. Writing from a base that includes institutional and clinical care as well as the private practice, he has much to say to workers everywhere: And how he writes! Don&#39;t miss his Afterword or Adam Phillips&#39; elegantly attuned introduction.&#39;- Harold N. Boris&#39;Michael Eigen&#39;s writings on psychoanalysis represent a unique clinical and theoretical contribution. Of the many psychoanalysts writing today, Eigen is one of the few who have captured in writing the emotional intensity of the analyst&#39;s encounter with himself as well as his patients. Not content to coast on the surface provided by a professional language, Eigen pushes psychoanalytic theory into the vortex of lived experience of anxiety and pain, but also hope. Even as he is enveloping his radical devotion to phenomenological reality in the Winnicottian tradition, Eigen refuses to throw out Freudian theory - as he writes, &#34;We do not know what to do with this multiplicity, but we are not free to evade it.&#34; Even when he is the theoretical virtuoso, he offers the reader a sense of one mind working to fathom another mind. And even as he conveys the struggle of analyst and patient to overcome the deadness of not feeling, he offers no facile rhetoric of authenticity, no sense of having the answer. It is hard to imagine any clinician or scholar who will not be moved by Eigen&#39;s writing to feel and understand the psychoanalytic project afresh.&#39;- Jessica Benjamin</p><h2>Bang!: The Complete History of the Universe</h2><p>With one big bang, the universe exploded into being 13.7 million years ago.

That's the tagline of <i>Modern Principles</i> and our teaching philosophy. Nobel laureate Vernon Smith put it this way: <br><i>At the heart of economics is a scientific mystery... a scientific mystery as deep, fundamental and inspiring as that of the expanding universe or the forces that bind matter... How is order produced from freedom of choice?</i> We want students to be inspired by this mystery and by how economists have begun to solve it. Thus, we show how markets interconnect and respond in surprising ways to changes in resources and preferences. Consider, for example, how markets respond to a reduction in the supply of oil. Of course, the price of oil increases giving consumers an incentive to use less and suppliers an incentive to discover more. But an increase in the price of oil also encourages Brazilian sugar cane farmers to devote more of their production to ethanol and less to sugar thereby driving up the price of sugar. An increase in the price of sugar means a reduction in the quantity of candy demanded. So one way the market responds to a reduction in the supply of oil is by encouraging consumers to eat less candy! In analyses like this, we teach students to see the invisible hand and in so doing to understand their world. Similarly, we offer a unique and simple proof of the amazing invisible hand theorem that without any central direction competitive markets allocate production across firms in a way that minimizes aggregate costs! To understand their world students must understand when self-interest promotes the social interest and when it does not. Thus, <i>Modern Principles</i> has in-depth analyses of externalities, public goods, and ethical issues with market incomes and trade. Moreover, we always discuss economic theory in the context of real world problems such as the decline of the ocean fisheries, climate change, and the shortage of human organs for transplant.<br></p><p>Tyler Cowen is Holbert C.

As her neighbor Gilbert Markham comes to discover, Helen has painful secrets buried in her past that even his love for her cannot easily overcome.</p><p>Over a short period in the 1840s, the three Bront� sisters working in a remote English <br>parsonage produced some of the best-loved and most-enduring of all novels: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, a book that created a scandal when it was published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelling in its imaginative power and bold naturalism, the novel opens in the autumn of 1827, when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Bront�'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Bront� scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Bront�, with all the Bront� taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Bront�." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles.

The tale unfolds through a series of letters between two friends as one man learns more about Helen Huntingdon and the past that brought this young painter and single mother to Wildfell Hall.

The initial developer support for Windows NT has been phenomenal--developers have demonstrated more than 50 Windows NT applications only months after receiving the pre-release version of the software. This authoritative text--by a member of the Windows NT development group--is a a richly detailed technical overview of the design goals and architecture of Windows NT. (Operating Systems)</p><p>Beginning with broad NT concepts and then focusing sequentially on various key systems, Solomon dissects NT with a surgeon's care and a software engineer's thoroughness. That's not to say that this book is mainly about writing programs. Rather, this is the kind of guide that power users wish for, explaining why and how things happen and glossing over very little. Programmers will value the clear NT API hints. <p> Initially, the author talks about important NT tools (such as Performance Monitor) and concepts (such as the idea of virtual memory and how it's mapped). He illustrates all abstract concepts with excellent conceptual drawings that make it easier to comprehend what NT is doing. A chapter on NT's architecture explains how the system works as a whole. Later chapters focus on individual subsystems, providing extensive coverage of processes, memory, input/output, security, caches, and NT. After reading the chapter on memory management, for instance, you'll have a solid grasp of paging and the internal settings that affect it. The book also contains experiments that guide the reader through concept-illustrating procedures. For example, readers crash their machines to see and analyze the dump log--a valuable skill. <i>--David Wall</i></p>A direct consequence of the relatively short time Windows NT has been in use in the industry is represented by the lack of punctual and accurate information about the internals of the system, as opposed to the abundance of texts treating higher level themes. The first edition of <i>Inside Windows NT</i>, written by Helen Custer of Microsoft and based on version 3.1 of the product, was indeed one of the best titles falling into the first category. From that solid ground David Solomon has jumped in, updated the contents, and also added a lot of new insights on those topics that characterize the latest releases of Windows NT. The result is not only an up-to-date reproposition of the former book -- it is a largely restructured and organically reorganized manual, whose focus is on Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3. Frequent marginal notes and the entire final chapter also anticipate what to expect from the upcoming Windows NT 5.0. <p> </p><p>After spending some pages delineating its target and introducing the basic elements that make up the foundation of NT, the book digs deeper and unveils the logic of most aspects of the system. Processes and threads, the mythical memory manager (whose vivisection turned out particularly well), the cache manager, the HAL (acronym for Hardware Abstraction Layer) and the Executive, kernel mode components, and security are just some of the myriad topics covered throughout the chapters. Things like GDI, USER, networking and COM are deliberately left out, as each of them would deserve an entire book. The level of detail is excellent, but I was just as impressed by the high degree of readability and, in general, by the ability of the author to follow a progressive approach in presenting new material without losing sight of the organic whole. The strength of this book&#x2019;s educational aspect is a big upside considering the innate complexity of the subject, and renders <i>Inside Windows NT</i> an extraordinary candidate as a textbook in support of professional seminars and academic courses...Read more from this review. --<i>Davide Marcato, Dr. Dobb's Journal</i> -- <i>Dr. Dobb's Journal</i></p></p><h2>Gullivers Travels</h2><p>Gullivers Travels [paperback] Swift, Jonathan [Aug 01, 1960]</p><p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics."It is universally read, from the <br>cabinet council to the nursery," remarked Alexander Pope when Gulliver's Travels was published in 1726. One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-<br>able hardbound editions of impor-<br>tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-<br>fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring<br>as its emblem the running torch-<br>bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: "Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement. Swift had not only the judgment with which to arrive at a reasoned view of the world but the fancy by means of which he could re-create that world in a form which teaches where argument fails and which satisfies all while misleading none."</p><h2>An Anecdoted Topography of Chance: By Daniel Spoerri, Robert Filliou, Emmett Williams, Dieter Roth, Roland Topor.</h2><p>Originally published by Something Else Press in 1966 and now acknowledged as one of the most important and entertaining artists&#x2019; books of the postwar period, <i>An Anecdoted Topography of Chance</i> is a unique collaborative work by four artists associated with the Fluxus and Nouveau R�alisme movements, here released in a new edition. Following a rambling conversation with his friend Robert Filliou, Daniel Spoerri one day mapped the objects lying at random on the table in his room, adding a rigorously scientific description of each. These objects subsequently evoked associations, memories and anecdotes from both the original author and his friends Filliou, Emmett Williams, Dieter Roth and Roland Topor. Many of the principal participants of Fluxus also make an appearance (texts by Higgins, Jouffroy, Kaprow, Restany and Tinguely are included, among others). <i>An Anecdoted Topography of Chance</i> is an archaeological game, a poem to the arbitrary, an encyclopaedia, and above all else, a celebration of friendship and creativity. The <i>Topography</i> personifies and predates the spirit of Fluxus and constitutes one of the strangest and most compelling insights into the artist&#x2019;s life. From the banal detritus of the everyday a virtual autobiography emerges, of four perceptive, witty and exceptionally congenial artists.</p><p>This amazing book is a rabbit hole exploration (Allie Wist <i>Saveur</i>)</p><h2>The Awakening and Selected Short Fiction (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series) (B&amp;N Classics)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Awakening and Selected Short Fiction&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RKate Chopin&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Classics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;Rseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

As a young widow, she contended with the provincialism of Cloutierville for two more years before returning to St. Louis to live with her mother, Eliza. When Eliza died of cancer just one year later, Chopin was heartbroken. But she also began to participate in the intellectual life of the city and to make serious efforts to establish herself as a professional author. Although she moved in literary circles, she resisted alliance with any particular group. A brief membership in the Wednesday Club, a select coterie of women intellectuals who gathered for conversation and debate, only strengthened her distaste for such organized activities. More than once, her fiction depicts women reformers or intellectuals in unflattering terms. Concerned about his wife's erratic behavior in <i>The Awakening</i>, L�once consults the family doctor, who asks him if she has "been associating of late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women-super-spiritual superior beings." These words drip with a disdain that is unrelieved by authorial commentary. Struggling to find venues for her work, Chopin wrote regularly and kept careful records of submissions and rejections. At first, she was most successful with regional publications, placing her poem "<i>If It Might Be</i>" in a Chicago magazine called <i>America</i> and short stories in the <i>Philadelphia Music Journal</i> and <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. It proved more difficult to access national periodicals like <i>The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's</i>, and <i>Century</i>. At a time when the social conservatism of the Victorian era still prevailed, Chopin's treatment of such controversial topics as extramarital affairs, venereal disease, murder, and miscegenation often made her work unpalatable to the major literary magazines. Eventually she would break into this market by publishing stories in nationally circulating periodicals such as <i>Vogue, Century</i>, and <i>Youth's Companion</i>. </p><p>Among Chopin's literary influences was the French writer Guy de Maupassant, whose realism and formal sophistication she admired. Her respect for his frank treatment of taboo subjects inspired her to translate a number of his stories, but their controversial nature made publication difficult. A more conventional early model was the eminent realist author and magazine editor William Dean Howells, who sent her a brief note of praise for her short story "<i>Boulot and Boulotte</i>." For the depiction of strong, independent female characters, Chopin looked to Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary Wilkins Freeman. She has frequently been grouped with these women as a writer of local color fiction, a genre unjustly dismissed by several generations of critics. More recently, scholars have seen her use of local color techniques as a strategy to gain a foothold in the literary marketplace and to stake a claim in contemporary debates about gender, race, and region. From this perspective, her short story "<i>A Gentleman of Bayou T�che</i>," in which an artist from the city attempts to exploit a humble fisherman for his "local color," reads like an allegory for the regional writer's confrontation with the literary establishment. Reviewers of Chopin's first collection, <i>Bayou Folk</i> (1894), failed to notice such instances of understated social commentary. While generally positive, contemporary responses hailed her depiction of charming local details, rather than her treatment of social issues. Reviewers found a more complicated outlook and maturity of authorial voice in her second collection, A Night in Acadie (1897). An essay in the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> praising Chopin's artistry and psychological insight urged readers to think beyond the associations with local color, to recognize "gifts . . . that go deeper than mere patois and local description." A second review demurred, describing Chopin as a specialist in the "childlike southern people who are the subject of her brief romances" and expressing regret that some of the stories were "marred by one or two slight and unnecessary coarseness [sic]." </p><p>Despite considerable appreciation by her contemporaries, Chopin would have remained neglected by literary history if it were not for the recovery of <i>The Awakening</i> in the 1960s. Its renewed popularity also brought attention to the whole corpus of her work, which includes numerous poems, essays, and short stories, as well as her first novel, <i>At Fault</i>. These texts illuminate many of the concerns of <i>The Awakening</i> but are also of considerable interest in their own right. Read in its entirety, Chopin's fiction introduces a broad swath of personalities, from impoverished blacks and Acadians of the Bayou to plantation elites and urban intellectuals. Whereas some stories turn seemingly trivial events-the shopping spree of an abstemious middle-aged woman, a country girl's visit to the circus-into dramatic interior conflicts, others deal with more overtly controversial issues such as miscegenation, venereal disease, murder, and extramarital sex. The relatively circumscribed geographical parameters of Chopin's fiction extend from lively, cosmopolitan New Orleans to the insular, rural byways of nineteenth-century Louisiana. Unlike the minutely detailed, inclusive catalogues of realist fiction, her preference is for the sketch, which conveys an impression rather than a sharply delineated picture. Frequently, Chopin writes as an insider whose intimacy with her subjects is conveyed through the use of local dialect and allusions. As a result, whereas the human dramas are readily accessible, contemporary readers may struggle to gain a precise understanding of character and locale.<br></p></p><h2>The Enneagram Type 1: The Moral Perfectionist (The Enneagram Collection)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Type 1: The Moral Perfectionist</em></strong><strong>, from The Enneagram Collection, is for anyone who loves the Enneagram and wants to go deeper with this interactive book exploring the unique motivations, longings, and strengths and weaknesses of a Type 1&#x2014;those who have a core desire to have integrity, to be good, balanced, accurate, virtuous, and right.</strong></p><p>The Enneagram has never been more popular.

The illustration program, custom crafted by Kevin Kane, tells a clear graphical story about the principles of structural analysis in the design and construction of buildings. </p> <p> Intended for students and professionals in architecture, construction, and civil engineering technology, this text is intended as the next step after a basic introduction to structures. A highly visual, non-calculus approach is employed. Organized into two parts, the first part of the book covers statics while the second part covers the strength of materials. </p> <ul> <b>Features of this new edition include:</b><br> <li>Reviews of software programs currently available for structural analysis.</li> <li>A new chapter on steel connections.</li> <li>New illustrations added to aid reader understanding.</li> <li>Updated reference tables and specifications.</li> </ul><p> A primary aim of this book has been to develop and present basic structural concepts in an easily understood manner using "building" examples and illustrations to supplement the text. Much of this material has been field tested, revised, and modified over a course of 25 years of teaching. </p> <p> Introducing structural theory, without relying on a predominantly mathematical treatment, has been challenging to say the least&#x2014;and a non-calculus engineering alternative to the topic seemed essential if the target audience (students of architecture, building construction, and some engineering technology programs) were to remain interested. Early on it was decided that a heavily illustrated, visual approach was essential in connecting and linking structural theory to real buildings and components. Using examples and problems that are commonly found in buildings and structures around us seemed to be a logical way of introducing mathematically based material in a nonthreatening way. </p> <p> This text is organized along the lines of traditional textbooks on statics and strength of materials because it seems to be the most logical approach. A sound understanding of statics and strength of materials establishes a theoretical and scientific basis for understanding structural theory Numerical 5alculations are included as a way of explaining and testing one's understanding of the principles involved. Many fully worked example problems are included, with additional problems for student practice. An interesting, descriptive narrative of structural concepts may stimulate the student's interest in the subject matter, but it does not engage the student enough to ensure understanding. </p> <p> This text is intended as the next step following a basic introductory course on structural principles (for example, Salvadori and Heller's <i>Structure in Architecture&#x2013;The Building of Buildings</i>). Organizationally, the book consists of two parts: Statics in Chapters 2 through 4, and Strength of Materials covered in Chapters 5 through 10. Load Tracing in Chapter 4 is not customarily covered in statics, but was intentionally included to illustrate the power of the basic principle of mechanics and the use of free-body diagrams. Gravity and lateral load tracing are often covered in subsequent structures courses, but the fundamentals can be introduced at this stage without much anxiety on the student's part. Chapter 11 is included as a synthesis of the prior topics and summarizes some of the overall architectural, structural, and constructional issues outlined in the introduction to Chapter 1. </p> <p> A heavy emphasis is placed on the use of free-body diagrams in understanding the forces acting on a structural member. All problems begin with a pictorial representation of a structural component or assembly and are accompanied by a free-body diagram. Illustrations are used extensively to ensure that the student sees the connection between the real object and its abstraction. Chapter 3 uses the principles discussed in the previous chapter to solve an array of determinate structural frameworks. Load tracing in Chapter 4 attempts to examine the overall structural condition with regard to gravity and lateral loads. This chapter illustrates the interaction of one member with other members and introduces the concept of load paths that develop within a building. </p> <p> Chapter 5 introduces the concepts of stress and strain and material properties as they relate to materials commonly used in the building industry. The text would be greatly complemented by a course on the methods and materials of construction taken concurrently or before the strength of materials portion. Cross-sectional properties are covered in Chapter 6, again with an emphasis on commonly used beam and column shapes. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 develop the basis for beam and column analysis and design. Chapter 10 on steel connections has been added to this second edition to emphasize the importance of the interconnection of parts in creating a stable, functional, and economical structure. Elastic theory has been utilized throughout, and the allowable stress method has been employed for the design of beams and columns. Some simplifications have been introduced to beam and column design equations to eliminate the complexity unwarranted for preliminary design purposes. Sizing of beams and columns is well within the range of a final, closely engineered element sized by the more complex formulas. It is assumed that students will take subsequent courses in timber, steel, and concrete. Therefore, building code equations and criteria have not been incorporated in these chapters. </p> <p> No attempt was made to include the study of indeterminate beams and frames since it would require substantial development beyond the purview of statics and strength of materials. Indeterminate structures is probably one of the more important structural topics for building designers since most of the commercial and institutional buildings of moderate size are of this type. Indeterminate structural behavior using one of the many available structural analysis software packages is emerging as a critical area of study for all future building designers. </p> <p> This text is intended to be used for a one-semester (15-week) class or two 10-week quarters in architectural, building construction, and engineering technology programs. Chapters 4 and 10 might be of interest and use to the civil engineering student who wants to better understand building components in a larger context. Also, Chapters 8 and 9 might be useful for quick preliminary methods of sizing beams and columns. Although this text might be used for self-study, its real benefit is to supplement the instruction received in class. </p> <p> Many of the topics covered in the text can be demonstrated in model form in class. Slides of actual buildings representing the subject being covered help to reinforce the idea through visual images. Previous teaching experience has been convincing about the need to use a variety of media and techniques to illustrate a concept. Structures should by no means be a "dry" subject. </p> <p> Computers and the availability of powerful structural software for desktop and laptop computers have revolutionized the field of structural analysis and design. Most students enrolled in our programs are generally quite computer literate and expect extensive use of structural software in solving statics and strength of materials problems. However, it is this author's belief that the basic principles and numerical techniques used in this book are easily within the grasp and understanding of our students. A sound, fundamental working knowledge of free-body diagrams, equations of equilibrium, stress, strain, and bending equations are key to developing a mental framework for the understanding of structural behavior. Basic equations of equilibrium, although quantitative in nature, still evokes a qualitative, intuitive sense about a structure. Matrix-based computer programs are highly abstract and mathematical with little connectivity to real structures, except perhaps for the exceptionally gifted student. </p> <p> Computers can certainly be used to supplement these early foundation structures courses and add to the student's understanding of structural behavior through the generation of graphically displayed output. Although there are many excellent structural analysis/design software packages available for purchase, reference will be made in selected sections of this book to <i>free</i> structural software of a limited nature accessible on the Internet. </p> <p> As part of an ongoing effort by the United States to convert from the U.S. customary system of units to the international system of units (SI metric units), some example and practice problems in this text use the SI units. A table defining both the U.S. customary system of units and the SI metric units is included on page vii. </p> <p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p> <p> I am indebted and grateful to a vast number of students over many years who have used the earlier versions of this text and generously given suggestions for changes and improvements. </p> <p> In particular, this book would not be possible without the shared authorship of Kevin Kane and his skill and insightfulness illustrating the structural concepts. Kevin's major contributions, along with drawing and coordinating all of the illustrations, are evident in Chapters 4 and 10. Additional thanks to Cynthia Esselman, Murray Hutchins, and Gail Wong for drawing assistance that helped us meet deadlines. </p> <p> Special acknowledgment and appreciation is given to Tim Williams and Loren Brandford for scanning and typing assistance; Robert Albrecht for reviewing the earlier manuscript; Ed Lebert for some of the practice problems; Chris Countryman for proofreading the problems and solutions; Bert Gregory and Jay Taylor for providing information pertinent to Chapter 10; and Elga Gemst, a teaching assistant from long ago, for helping me prepare the original strength of materials sections and the biographies of famous thinkers of the past. Thanks also go to the reviewers of this edition: Robert W. Aderholdt, Auburn University; David Bilbo, Texas A&amp;M University; and Madan Mehta, University of Texas, Arlington; and our senior editor at Prentice Hall, Ed Francis. Finally, thanks to a friend and colleague, Frank Ching, who encouraged us to pursue this project. He has served as a mentor and role model for many of us who teach here at the University of Washington. </p> <p> A warm and sincere thanks to our families for their support and sacrifice throughout this process.

It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

Three witnesses, involved with him during his lifetime in different capacities - a distant relative, an orderly and a jockey who had an affair with his wife - remember him and help the reader piece together the realities behind the man and his death. A groundbreaking work, for which Claude Simon devised a prose technique mimicking the mind&#39;s flexible thought processes, &#34;The Flanders Road&#34; is not only a masterpiece of stylistic innovation, but also a haunting portrayal - based on a real-life incident - of the chaos and savagery of war.</p><p></p><h2>To the Lighthouse</h2><p>An English family&#39;s complex lives are followed and picked up again after a 10 year hiatus in order to explore the effects of time</p><p>From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Virginia Woolf constructs a remarkable and moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life, and the conflict between male and female principles, in what is probably her most popular novel.Though its fame as an icon of twentieth-century literature rests primarily on the brilliance of its narrative technique and the impressionistic beauty of its prose, &#39;To The Lighthouse&#39; is above all the story of a quest, and as such it possesses a brave and magical universality.</p><h2>What Your 5th Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good Fifth-Grade Education (Core Knowledge)</h2><p>Grade by grade, these groundbreaking and successful books provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of a good education for first to sixth graders.<br><br>B &amp; W photographs, linecuts, and maps throughout; two-color printing.</p><p>de, these groundbreaking and successful books provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of a good education for first to sixth graders.<br><br>B &amp; W photographs, linecuts, and maps throughout; two-color printing.E.

The 56 pieces date from the 9th to the 18th centuries. Formerly owned by Chinese emperors, they document fluctuating imperial taste and bear witness to an enduring high standard, from Jun ware from the 12th and 13th centuries--smudged generously with mottled plum and purple glazes--to the delicate naturalism of 18th-century Jingdezhen tea sets, painted with lotus blossoms. Rounding out the many color photographs and catalogue essay by curator Scott are other pieces by Scott and scholars George Kuwayama, Roderick Whitfield, Wu Tung and Denise Patry Leidy discussing archeological research, the origins of ceramic painting styles, the role played by such porcelains in Chinese painting itself and the influence of East-West trade on the art.

This original collection offers some of the greatest, rarest and most unusual werewolf stories ever. From the forests of Transylvania to the ordered lawns of an English country estate, here are all the classic aspects of the tale. You will encounter shadows that lope under the moon, chilling howls, family curses, crimson feasts, the desperate chase and the deathly duel. But you will also find the werewolf in less expected guises as an adversary for Sherlock Holmes, as a myth of the Wild West, and as a figure restored to its origins in folk and fairy tales. With an informative introduction by Mark Valentine that follows the traces of the werewolf in literature, and its links to Dracula, Jekyll &amp; Hyde, and The Hound of the Baskervilles, this superb collection will make you fear the full moon.</p><p></p><h2>The Elements of Philosophy: Readings from Past and Present</h2><p><em>The Elements of Philosophy: Readings from Past and Present</em> offers an extensive collection of classic and contemporary readings, organized topically into five main sections: Religion and Belief, Moral and Political Philosophy, Metaphysics and Epistemology, Philosophy of Mind and Language, and Life and Death. Within these broad areas, readings are arranged in clusters that address both traditional issues--such as the existence of God, justice and the state, knowledge and skepticism, and free will--and contemporary topics--including God and science, just war theory, vegetarianism, and time travel. Carefully chosen selections from a wide range of pre-20th-century philosophers are paired with writings from more than fifty leading contemporary philosophers and thinkers. The traditional philosophers represented range from Plato and Aristotle to Immanuel Kant and A.J. Ayer; the contemporary philosophers include Saul Kripke, David Lewis, Thomas Nagel, Derek Parfit, Hilary Putnam, Robert Nozick, Judith Jarvis Thomson, John Rawls, Bernard Williams, and Susan Wolf. Also included are selections from linguist Noam Chomsky, physicist Albert Einstein, and psychologist William James.<br> Edited by a team of scholars who are also highly esteemed instructors, <em>The Elements of Philosophy</em> is uniquely student-friendly. A team of undergraduate philosophy majors played a central role in helping to select topics, choose readings, and identify terms likely to require clarification. In response to their suggestions, the volume includes detailed introductions to each section, explanatory footnotes that define unfamiliar terms and concepts, an extensive glossary, and a guide to further resources. A companion Instructor's Manual, available on CD, offers article summaries, suggested essay questions, reading guides, model handouts, and sample syllabi.

While he is undoubtedly one of the best-loved and best-known visionaries of American art, photographers also recognize him as a pioneer of technique, a theoretician, and as one of the great teachers of the craft of photography. <br><br>His zone system has been widely adapted, but Adams unique imagery also relied on his determination and application at every stage of the photographic process; he spent years in his darkroom, as well as out in the open air. For decades, this kind of attention to detail required the kind of equipment, time, and facilities that were out of the reach of most photographers--but now, in the digital age, technology has finally made his techniques accessible. <br><br>This book will show you what can be learned from Adams working process, and how these lessons can be applied today. The craft of Adams photography is discussed, and the ZONE SYSTEM is related to the digital age. Sections on light, composition, mood, and the darkroom all show what can be achieved today using and understanding his thinking. Michael Frye's own photography provides many stunning examples of the results that can be achieved and, as one of Adams' natural successors in the field, he is well placed to analyze the inspirational shots which open each chapter.</p><p>Michael Frye has lived either on or near Yosemite National Park since 1983, and in that time has built up a reputation as one of the most exciting current practioners of fine landscape and nature photography. He has written numerous magazine articles on the art and technique of photography. His work is also featured in Landscape: The World&#39;s Top Photographers. His photographs have been published in over thirty countries around the world; magazine credits include National Wildlife, Outdoor Photographer, American Photo, Sunset, and Texas Highways.</p><h2>The Great Cover-up: Nixon and the scandal of Watergate</h2><p>The <i>Washington Post</i> city news editor who broke the story twenty years ago reconstructs the Watergate scandal from the failed break-in at the Democratic headquarters to President Nixon's resignation.

Arguing that we can make sense of computers as tools only when we simultaneously grasp their roles as metaphors and political icons, Paul Edwards shows how Cold War social and cultural contexts shaped emerging computer technology&#x2015;and were transformed, in turn, by information machines.</p><p><i>The Closed World</i> explores three apparently disparate histories&#x2015;the history of American global power, the history of computing machines, and the history of subjectivity in science and culture&#x2015;through the lens of the American political imagination. In the process, it reveals intimate links between the military projects of the Cold War, the evolution of digital computers, and the origins of cybernetics, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Edwards begins by describing the emergence of a "closed-world discourse" of global surveillance and control through high-technology military power. The Cold War political goal of "containment" led to the SAGE continental air defense system, Rand Corporation studies of nuclear strategy, and the advanced technologies of the Vietnam War. These and other centralized, computerized military command and control projects&#x2015;for containing world-scale conflicts&#x2015;helped closed-world discourse dominate Cold War political decisions. Their apotheosis was the Reagan-era plan for a "<i>Star Wars</i>" space-based ballistic missile defense.</p><p>Edwards then shows how these military projects helped computers become axial metaphors in psychological theory. Analyzing the Macy Conferences on cybernetics, the Harvard Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, and the early history of artificial intelligence, he describes the formation of a "cyborg discourse." By constructing both human minds and artificial intelligences as information machines, cyborg discourse assisted in integrating people into the hyper-complex technological systems of the closed world.</p><p>Finally, Edwards explores the cyborg as political identity in science fiction&#x2015;from the disembodied, panoptic AI of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, to the mechanical robots of <i>Star Wars</i> and the engineered biological androids of <i>Blade Runner</i>&#x2015;where Information Age culture and subjectivity were both reflected and constructed.</p><p><i>Inside Technology series</i></p></p><p>Edwards traces how computers have emerged as the dominant technology as a direct result of Cold War politics and the defense research it engendered. From the first use of room-size mainframes to coordinate missile systems, Pentagon research aimed toward complete computer control, including the budget-busting and ultimately impractical Strategic Defensive Initiative. Edwards relates how the technolog--which is now so open as to be nearly anarchic--began in strictly enclosed secrecy. The military computer goal of perfect &#34;command, control and communication&#34; systems was understood to mean communication only within a very closed world. Edwards&#39; thesis is that this approach influenced the very structure of our modern computers.Paul N. Edwards is Professor of Information and History at the University of Michigan. He is the author of <i>A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming</i> (2010) and a coeditor (with Clark Miller) of <i>Changing the Atmosphere: Expert Knowledge and Environmental Governance</i> (2001), both published by the MIT Press.</p><h2>Inductive Bible Study: A Comprehensive Guide to the Practice of Hermeneutics</h2><p>Two seasoned educators provide step-by-step instructions on how to think inductively and do inductive Bible study, demonstrating the practice of that approach. Now in paper.</p><p>"For half a century, Robert Traina's method of inductive Bible study has taught students the most important critical-thinking skill of all: how to read! His method trains people to attend closely to what is in a text and what is not in a text, to follow a text's argument, and to map its narrative flow. Now David Bauer adds to the collaborative mix his own formidable strengths as an experienced teacher of inductive Bible study and as an internationally recognized biblical scholar. Together they present a finely honed guide to the process of observation, interpretation, and appropriation, enhanced with examples of how to execute each step and with helpful discussions about both the place of their approach in the landscape of contemporary hermeneutical debates and the connections between critical approaches and their inductive method. This volume lays an essential foundation for critical analysis and careful exegesis."--<b>David A. deSilva</b>, Ashland Theological Seminary<br><br>"I have personally used Bauer and Traina's method of inductive Bible study for more than twenty-five years and can testify to its effectiveness for understanding Scripture in ways that are both academically responsible and pastorally relevant. The approach allows Scripture to reveal itself, to speak on its own terms in ways that overcome the limitations and presuppositions of its readers. This volume presents that time-honored approach for a new generation--and it is a remarkable achievement! Students will appreciate a text that is so immediately accessible and, eventually, will come to treasure this volume as a handbook to be consulted repeatedly throughout their professional careers."--<b>Mark Allan Powell</b>, Trinity Lutheran Seminary<br><br>"Many of us learned years ago to begin Bible study for ourselves with 'observation, interpretation, and application,' doing as much as possible on our own before turning to other resources. We may not have known one of the classic sources that outlined this method in comprehensive detail by Robert Traina. Now masterfully updated, with state-of-the-art scholarship and bibliographic references, this tome has been made useful for a new generation by David Bauer and Robert Traina. Part hermeneutics, part exegesis, part philosophy and logic, with numerous illustrations from Scripture itself, <i>Inductive Bible Study</i> does not supplant the standard works in each of these areas but helpfully supplements many of them."--<b>Craig L.

Any attempt has to reconcile evidence garnered from such diverse fields as developmental and evolutionary biology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, cognitive psychology, psychiatry, and philosophy.Having laid the groundwork in his critically acclaimed books <i>Neural Darwinism</i> (Basic Books, 1987) and <i>Topobiology</i> (Basic Books, 1988), Nobel laureate Gerald M. Edelman now proposes a comprehensive theory of consciousness in <i>The Remembered Present</i>. Integrating findings generated by the recent explosive growth in the neurosciences with current knowledge of anatomy, cell biology, and psychology, Edelman has been able to construct a detailed model of how we become aware of our own existence.In addition to providing a scientific account of brain function and consciousness, the theory advanced in <i>The Remembered Present</i> will have a significant impact on a wide variety of fields. It provides a new outlook that may prompt fundamental revisions in the way linguists view language, physicians classify mental diseases, and philosophers look at the mind-body problem.</p><p><b>Gerald M.

In this collection of short stories, Hubert Selby Jr. plunges the reader into the violent, passionate worlds of his protagonists and captures perfectly the delicate balance between joy and despair.</p><p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: &#39;I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.&#39; In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, Song of the Silent Snow, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream starred Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn and was directed by Darren Aronofsky. Hubert Selby Jr died in Highland Park, Los Angeles, California in April 2004.These 15 stories from the author of Last Exit to Brooklyn range from clipped street vernacular to poetic description, but common to all the pieces in this slightly uneven collection is a compassionate vision. "The Coat" is essential Selby: an unsparing portrait of a homeless man whose relationship with his coathis lifelineis more humanly meaningful than the violent city around him. A girl on a subway becomes a man's fantasy object, a salesman finds courage and success through fortune cookies, a father smashes a TV to gain his son's attention, and in a twisted way he doesthe son tapes the incident: Selby's work is earthy, thoughtful, funny, and about a recognizably uncaring world.

More recent generations of pictorial map artists have continued that traditional mixture of whimsy and fact, combining cartographic elements with text and images and featuring bold and arresting designs, bright and cheerful colors, and lively detail. In the United States, the art form flourished from the 1920s through the 1970s, when thousands of innovative maps were mass-produced for use as advertisements and decorative objects&#x2014;the golden age of American pictorial maps.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Picturing America</i> is the first book to showcase this vivid and popular genre of maps. Geographer Stephen J. Hornsby gathers together 158 delightful pictorial jewels, most drawn from the extensive collections of the Library of Congress. In his informative introduction, Hornsby outlines the development of the cartographic form, identifies several representative artists, describes the process of creating a pictorial map, and considers the significance of the form in the history of Western cartography. Organized into six thematic sections, <i>Picturing America</i> covers a vast swath of the pictorial map tradition during its golden age, ranging from &#x201c;Maps to Amuse&#x201d; to &#x201c;Maps for War.&#x201d; Hornsby has unearthed the most fascinating and visually striking maps the United States has to offer: Disney cartoon maps, college campus maps, kooky state tourism ads, World War II promotional posters, and many more.

It includes the playful (distorted views of the country from the perspective of New Yorkers, Texans and Californians); the obscure (a map of volunteer fire departments in Philadelphia, circa 1792, commissioned and drawn in 1938); and more of the obscure (a map of Michigan bakeries)." (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"An underappreciated form of American visual art: the pictorial map.

(<i>CNN Style</i>)<br><br>"Fifty-eight full-color, high-quality pictorial maps that amuse, instruct, and show place and region, industry, wars, and the postwar US provide a variety of perspectives to describe the country. The drawings, created primarily from the 1920s to the 1960s by US artists and mapmakers, mostly convey each designer's own world view.&nbsp;Hornsby assiduously collected the maps and images thematically. . . . Each map is annotated with bits of helpful information while providing temporal and spatial context.&nbsp;In describing the pictorial map as an American genre, Hornsby provides the contributions and biographies of notable professionals, many of whom were women, for the hundreds of maps published throughout the popular media.

(<i>Historical Geography</i>)<br><br>"Stephen Hornsby's <i>Picturing America: The Golden Age of Pictorial Maps</i> is a superbly-crafted visual feast. . . . Cartophiles and enthusiasts of twentieth-century American popular culture will relish the lavishly-reproduced color maps in the collection, more than 150 in all. Academic geographers and historians of cartography will also appreciate Hornsby's careful and thoughtful historical exegesis of a visual form that often has not been taken very seriously. The result is an enduring and endearing appreciation of pictorial maps that represents both the evolution and diversity of an especially American art form, one that has deep roots in earlier practices of visual representation and one that grew to reflect a buoyant, vibrant, and turbulent era in American popular culture."

In a spectacular coincidence, on March 28, 1979, less than two weeks after the movie came out, the worst accident in the history of commercial nuclear power in the United States occurred at Three Mile Island. For five days, the citizens of central Pennsylvania and the entire world, amid growing alarm, followed the efforts of authorities to prevent the crippled plant from spewing dangerous quantities of radiation into the environment. This book is the first comprehensive account of the causes, context, and consequences of the Three Mile Island crisis. In gripping prose, J. Samuel Walker captures the high human drama surrounding the accident, sets it in the context of the heated debate over nuclear power in the seventies, and analyzes the social, technical, and political issues it raised. His superb account of those frightening and confusing days will clear up misconceptions held to this day about Three Mile Island. <br><br>The heart of Walker's suspenseful narrative is a moment-by-moment account of the accident itself, in which he brings to life the players who dealt with the emergency: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the state of Pennsylvania, the White House, and a cast of scientists and reporters. He also looks at the aftermath of the accident on the surrounding area, including studies of its long-term health effects on the population, providing a fascinating window onto the politics of nuclear power and an authoritative account of a critical event in recent American history.</p><p>"A superb account of the frightening and confusing accident at Three Mile Island in the spring of 1979. Walker succeeds in providing, in suspenseful prose, the best account to date about the crisis.

Offering a mix of spiritual affirmations and stories about raising five children and her missionary work, Tebow urges women to take an active role in others&#x2019; lives (whether that be one&#x2019;s own children, or those in need). &#x201c;Every woman needs purpose,&#x201d; Tebow writes. &#x201c;We have the privilege and responsibility to use our God-given gifts and opportunities to influence this generation and those to come.&#x201d; Explaining how she designed scripture-based lesson plans to homeschool her children, Tebow stresses the importance of taking an active role in childhood education. Tebow also shares her experience performing missionary work in the Philippines, and the story of Tim surviving birth complications. Years later, after Tim won the Heisman trophy in 2007, she launched a pro-life organization providing prenatal care to mothers. This evangelical testimony also includes what Tebow calls &#x201c;God stories&#x201d; of times when she felt God&#x2019;s presence, including one particularly touching story about her mother-in-law finding God on her deathbed. Reminding women that &#x201c;influence is not accidental,&#x201d; Tebow&#x2019;s memoir will appeal to Christian mothers interested faith-driven parenting lessons. (Publishers Weekly)</p><h2>The American Dream: A Short History of an Idea that Shaped a Nation</h2><p>"The American Dream" is one of the most familiar and resonant phrases in our national lexicon, so familiar that we seldom pause to ask its origin, its history, or what it actually means.<br> In this fascinating short history, Jim Cullen explores the meaning of the American Dream, or rather the several American Dreams that have both reflected and shaped American identity from the Pilgrims to the present. Cullen begins by noting that the United States, unlike most other nations, defines itself not on the facts of blood, religion, language, geography, or shared history, but on a set of ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence and consolidated in the Constitution. At the core of these ideals lies the ambiguous but galvanizing concept of the American Dream, a concept that for better and worse has proven to be amazingly elastic and durable for hundreds of years and across racial, class, and other demographic lines. Cullen then traces a series of overlapping American dreams: the quest for of religious freedom that brought the Pilgrims to the "New World"; the political freedom promised in the Declaration; the dream of upward mobility, embodied most fully in the figure of Abraham Lincoln; the dream of home ownership, from homestead to suburb; the intensely idealistic--and largely unrealized--dream of equality articulated most vividly by Martin Luther King, Jr. The version of the American Dream that dominates our own time--what Cullen calls "the Dream of the Coast"--is one of personal fulfillment, of fame and fortune all the more alluring if achieved without obvious effort, which finds its most insidious expression in the culture of Hollywood.<br> For anyone seeking to understand a shifting but central idea in American history, <em>The American Dream</em> is an interpretive tour de force.</p><p><br><strong>Jim Cullen</strong> holds a Ph.D. in American Civilization from Brown University and teaches at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, in New York City. He is the author of <em>Born in the U.S.A.: Bruce Springsteen and the American Tradition</em> and <em>The Civil War in Popular Culture: A Reusable Past</em>, among other books.<br><br>"One man's provocative, worthwhile, and stimulating summation."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Cullen combs the riches of American history to analyze the American dream idea.... From these rich slices of American history, Cullen weaves a historical quilt illustrating key components of the idea.... This work combines the author's personal reflections with a cogent interpretation of American social and intellectual history."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"The American dream, as Jim Cullen shows in this useful, intelligent book, is more than a set of platitudes, and says something important about our national character."--<em>The Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"Its straightforward and engaging narrative style ought to appeal to general readers of American history, and its broader explorations of freedom, equality and shared ideals offers a nice dose of depth as well."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Jim Cullen's <em>The American Dream</em> is a tour de force through the whole of American history, from the Puritans to home ownership and California. Cullen daringly takes the notion of the American Dream as a touchstone for a huge swathe of American cultural history, and tracks its complexities, its shifts and conflicts--and unities. Gracefully written, elegantly unified, respectful toward disparate ideas, never indulgent of scholastic gobbledygook, the book has all the strength of its simplifications. A marvelous achievement." --Todd Gitlin<p></p><br>"Cullen is a master of the difficult art of distilling complex ideas without oversimplifying them. His grasp of American history is impressive, and his narrative is lucid, lively, and engaging. He has done an admirable job of summarizing, dramatizing, and giving a sense of personal urgency to successive versions of the American dream. I find the mixture of personal reflection and historical narrative quite effective and inviting.

The Frasers live in Mississauga, Canada.</p> <p><b>Bernice Lum</b> is an award-winning artist and illustrator of 40 books, including <i>3 Little Firefighters, Mighty Maddie</i> and <i>Stuff to Hold Your Stuff.</i></p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>We began as kids, eager to play and even more eager to fit in. We wore old sneakers and hats that made our ears stick out. We thought that our camp in a park in the suburbs was pretty close to being in the wilderness. We thought our counselors were the bee's knees, especially when bees stung our knees and we needed ice packs and a hug.</p> <p>We returned later as leaders, eager to help new campers make friends and have fun. We wore old sneakers and hats that made our ears stick out. We sometimes wished that our camp in a park in the suburbs was a sleep-away camp in the wilderness, but we were glad when we got to go home at the end of the day. We thought our campers were amazing and enthusiastic kids, even though they sometimes drove us a little crazy. We were proud when we could give them ice packs or a hug, but were even more proud when we handed the kids back to their parents, knowing that each child had enjoyed his or her day and felt like a meaningful part of a team.</p> <p>Years later, teaching in classrooms, we meet our former campers and feel honored when their 13-year-old brains remember a summer we spent together when they were five and we played camp games.</p> <p><b>Why We Play Games</b><br> Games are the most useful tool we know in aiding childhood development. They help children develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, listening skills, and the ability to think, respond and strategize. They encourage children to work together as a team to achieve a common goal. They allow children to experience success and failure in a positive and supportive environment. They help children communicate with each other and with adults. They teach children valuable life lessons, such as "if you break a rule, you have to deal with the consequences," or "if you brag about winning the game, nobody will want to play against you next time."</p> <p>Today, as children's time in front of various "screens" (television, computer, video game) is increasing, it is more and more important to encourage children to play games with other real live kids. Particularly for children who do not have brothers or sisters, and children who do not live in child-friendly neighborhoods, playing games at camp, at a recreation program, or at school may be the only time that they get to interact sociaUy with other children in their age group without the structure of learning a specific sports drill or vocabulary word.</p> <p>In addition to the social benefits of game playing, the health benefits of daily physical activity are well documented. Play is extremely important in developing healthy children who will go on to become healthy adults. By getting kids up and moving, we teach them the importance of physical activity in living a healthy and long life.</p> <p><b>Why We Wrote This Book</b><br> During our collective years as camp counselors and teachers-in-training we found a great many games books. Some of them included detailed rules for sports; some of them had exhaustive descriptions of pencil and paper games, or card games Some described games that encouraged pummeling playmates! But none of them seemed to contain what we needed. We needed camp-tested games that would excite even the most seasoned camp veterans. We needed a games book that took into consideration the concerns of today's recreation programs and addressed issues such as supervision, safety, and inclusion of children of all ages and abilities, including those with special needs or behavioral challenges.</p> <p>We began cobbling together binders with notes of games we played when visiting other programs, games we saw someone else play or heard someone describe, or games that we had tried before, but had found ways to modify to make them more exciting and engaging for each individual participant.</p> <p>As we moved from the world of day camps to the world of teaching, we decided we needed to write this book. We needed to take our notes and turn them into a guide for today's camp counselors, youth activity directors, recreational program leaders, counselors-in-training, teachers, coaches, scout and club leaders, parents and anyone else looking for creative group activities that include all participants and require little or no specialized equipment.</p> <p><b>How To Use This Book</b><br> Just because the title of the book is <i><b>The 175 Best Camp Games</b></i> doesn't mean these games are meant only for camps: they can be played in schoolyards, gymnasiums, community centers and backyards year-round. With games for all levels of movement and activity, and games that appeal to a variety of age groups and activities, this book will help you play with just about any group of children.</p> <p>We have divided the games into five chapters: Break the Ice, Take It Easy, Get Them Moving, Run Them Ragged, and Wet and Wild.</p> <p>Games in <b>BREAK THE ICE</b> work best at the beginning of the program session, as many of them are based on learning each other's names and getting to know each other. These games range in activity level and amount of space required, but none of them will leave your participants exhausted. And although these games are ice-breakers, they can be played throughout the camp session to develop group unity and a team atmosphere. At the end of this chapter we also include some activities especially good for building skills and spirit among leaders and leaders-in-training.</p> <p><b>TAKE IT EASY</b> games require only minimal movement. However, they are not necessarily easy or low-energy or quiet: we don't believe that any game is a quiet game (with the exception of Silent Ball, at page 66). These games are good to play right after an exhausting game of tag, or just after lunch when tummies are full. Most of these games will work well in small spaces. This chapter includes a number of brain games.</p> <p><b>GET THEM MOVING</b> games require some movement and physical activity. These games are usually on-your-feet and may require quick bursts of speed to get from one place to another. They generally require a larger playing area than Take It Easy games, but many can still be played inside. We've included relays in this chapter.</p> <p><b>RUN THEM RAGGED</b> games are designed to exhaust your participants, to burn off their energy, and to raise heart rates. These games usually require a medium or large space and, though many can be played in gyms, most are more fun outdoors. Many variations of tag are included in this chapter.</p> <p>Finally, <b>WET AND WILD</b> games are played in, around, or with water. Some of them are in-pool games, some can be played in a lake or river, and others use equipment such as buckets of water, sponges or water balloons to get participants wet and cooled off.</p> <p>In addition to dividing the games by chapter, we have used several handy icons to help game leaders match their programing needs to the games in the book. </p> <p>See the key, left, for an explanation of what each icon means.</p> <p>We also share our camp-tested strategies for keeping play fun, fair and safe. Throughout the book we have included many recommendations and tips on how to play games, encourage participants and structure a camp program. These <b>TIPS FOR LEADERS</b> are based on our years of experience, especially at camp but also in school environments, as well as many enjoyable occasions spent comparing notes with other camp counselors, parents and educators.</p> <p>With each game, you will find a list of required equipment, a recommended number of participants, and a game plan. Many games also include variations and suggestions for modifying games to include more or fewer participants, to increase or decrease the difficulty level, and to include participants with physical, intellectual or developmental disabilities or behavior challenges. These suggestions will help you keep your participants safe, happy and having fun, but leaders should continually monitor the games and activities the group is playing to prevent injured bodies and hurt feelings.</p> <p>We encourage you to use this book as a starting guide for developing your own recreation program, wheth</p></p><h2>Holt Texas!

This anger reaches its peak in the poems of the Mad Farmer, an open-ended sequence he's found himself impelled to continue against his better instincts. These poems can take the shape of manifestos, meditations, insults, Whitmanic fits and ravings&#x2015;these are often funny in spite of themselves. The Mad Farmer is a character as necessary, perhaps, as he is regrettable.</p> <p>Here are gathered the individual poems from Berry's various collections to offer the teachings of this amazing American voice. After the great success of the lovely <i>Window Poems</i>, Bob Baris of the Press on Scroll Road returns to design and produce an edition illustrated with etchings by Abigail Rover. James Baker Hall and William Kloefkorn offer poems here that also show how the Mad Farmer has escaped into the work of others. The whole is a wonderful testimony to the power of anger and humor to bring even the most terrible consequences into a focus otherwise impossible to obtain.</p></p><p><b>Wendell Berry</b>, an essayist, novelist, and poet, has been honored with the T.

The softly hued cartoon animals and dialogue balloons are skillfully combined on pages divided into framed sequences. There is plenty going on, but not so much as to be confusing. A scholarly hippo leads her class on a fun-filled adventure in numbers. Readers learn, along with Miss Prime's quirky students, about such important mathematical concepts as the definition of difference, writing a subtraction equation, regrouping, and three-digit equations. Most importantly, Leedy introduces practical application of mathematics when the class goes to the school fair. Tally and Otto use subtraction to sell snacks and Fay tries to break an obstacle-course record. Other brief episodes involve calculations as well. The text is interactive; a math problem is presented in every episode with the answers given on the back page.

It could have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <strong><em>Native Son</em></strong> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic.</p><p>Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Richard Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection on the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country and of what it means to be black in America.</p><p>This abridged edition of <em>Native Son</em> reprints the original edition from 1940.&nbsp;It also includes an essay by Wright, <em>How "Bigger" was Born, </em>as well as an afterword by John Reilly.</p></p><p>Bigger Thomas is doomed, trapped in a downward spiral that will lead to arrest, prison, or death, driven by despair, frustration, poverty, and incomprehension. As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...<p> A more compelling story than <i>Native Son</i> has not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. As Irving Howe asserted in 1963, "The day <i>Native Son</i> appeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture."</p><p> Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successful <i>Uncle Tom's Children</i>, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. In <i>Native Son</i>, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion: </p><blockquote>"I didn't want to kill," Bigger shouted. "But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. "It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth..."</blockquote> Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him. <i>--Andrew Himes</i><p>Right from the start, Bigger Thomas had been headed for jail. It could have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <em>Native Son</em> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Richard Wright's novel is just as powerful today as when it was written -- in its reflection of poverty and hopelessness, and what it means to be black in America. </p><p> This abridged edition includes an introduction, "How Bigger Was Born," by the author, as well as an afterword by John Reilly.</p></p><h2>Running Records: A Self-Tutoring Guide</h2><p><p><em>If you want to learn how to assess and interpret young children's oral reading, this book is your teacher. Johnston's writing is so refreshing and so explicit, you'll think he is by your side coaching you to success.</em><br> Susan Pasquarella<br>Roger Williams University</p><p>Here is a practical guide for teachers learning how to take running records of children's oral reading. If you know how to take running records, you can sit down next to a child who is reading and with only a blank sheet of paper and a pen you can make a record of the child's reading strategies. These records can be used to show growth, reveal problems, and provide a place for instructional conversations with children or colleagues.</p><p>Invented by Marie M. Clay, running records are unquestionably the most practical reading assessment technique for primary school teachers. This book and tape provide the most efficient way to learn how to use them. Peter H. Johnston walks you step by step through both recording and analysis as you listen to carefully selected examples of children's reading on the accompanying tape. This process of "ear-tuning" will change the way you listen to children read&#x2014;and the way you respond to their reading.</p></p><p><p>Peter Johnston grew up and taught elementary school in New Zealand before coming to the United States to earn his Ph.D. at the Center for the Study of Reading at the University of Illinois. At the time his plans did not include staying in the United States let alone getting married and raising a family. He now lives in Albany, New York, with his wife Tina, and a cat left behind by one of his (three) children returning briefly from college.</p><p>Peter's research and writing spring from his fascination with children's learning and, no less, teachers' teaching. Perversely, he believes that education is not simply about delivering information to children. He thinks it is more about building a just, caring society and that doing so will not detract from our more obviously pragmatic educational goals. In his most recent Stenhouse book,&nbsp;<i>Choice Words</i>, he uses his fascination with the relationship between language and learning to show how this works moment to moment in the classroom.</p><p>A professor at the State University of New York at Albany, Peter and his colleagues Becky Rogers and Cheryl Dozier recently researched their own teaching of beginning teachers in&nbsp;<i>Critical Literacy/Critical Teaching: Tools for Preparing Responsive Teachers. Knowing Literacy</i>, his most recent book on assessment, arose from his interest in the ways assessment teaching and learning are linked. His research on assessment has given him reason to be skeptical of high-stakes testing because of its effects on teaching and learning.</p><p>When asked to describe himself as a writer, he says that he "binges." While not recommended, this approach has resulted in some eight books and about fifty research articles, along with occasional awards from professional organizations. Some of this, of course, is accounted for by age. The departure of his youngest daughter into a teacher education program, along with his recent election to the Reading Hall of Fame, asserts his "old fart" status.</p><p>Beyond his family, research, soccer, singing, and humor sustain him. Failing that, a glass of chardonnay helps.</p></p><h2>Watch This! Student Edition, Level 1 (Storytown)</h2><p>Harcourt Storytown Grade 1 book 5 WATCH THIS! hardcover student textbook.

Widely regarded as one of the finest American novels from the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>James Thomas Farrell </b>(1904&#x2014;1979) was born in Chicago to a struggling family of second-generation Irish Catholic immi grants. In 1907, his father, James Farrell, a teamster unable to support his growing family, placed young Jim with his maternal grandparents. It was his grandparents&#x2019; neighborhood in Chicago&#x2019;s South Fifties that would provide the background to Farrell&#x2019;s <b>Studs Lonigan</b> trilogy. Farrell worked his way through the University of Chicago, shedding his Catholic upbringing and absorbing the works of William James, John Dewey, Sigmund Freud, while reading widely in American and European literature: Herman Melville, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, and James Joyce were critical influences on his literary development. &#x201c;<b>Slob</b>&#x201d; (1929), his first published story, was also his first render ing of the real life &#x201c;Studs Lonigan,&#x201d; a young man he had known growing up in Chicago. Farrell&#x2019;s first novel, <b>Young Lonigan</b> was published in 1932, followed by <b>The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan</b> (1934) and <b>Judgment Day</b> (1935)&#x2014;the three volumes making up his celebrated Studs Lonigan trilogy. A prolific writer, Farrell left more than fifty books of stories and novels behind him when he died in 1979. Alongside his masterpiece <b>Studs Lonigan</b>, Farrell&#x2019;s best-known works include the Danny O&#x2019;Neill novels, <b>A World I Never Made</b>, <b>No Star is Lost</b>, <b>Father and Son</b>, and <b>My Days of Anger</b>. James T. Farrell&#x2019;s <b>Studs Lonigan</b> trilogy is also available in Penguin Classics.<p>&nbsp;</p><br><p><b>Ann Douglas </b>teaches English at Columbia University. Her books include <b>Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s</b> and <b>The Feminization of American Culture</b>.</p><p> James T. Farrell's three-volume narrative of the brief, hapless life of William "Studs" Lonigan is a milestone in American literature, but an exceedingly problematical one. No series of volumes calling itself the Library of America would be complete without it, so it is good that Farrell has at last joined his contemporaries (and fellow naturalist writers) John Dos Passos and Theodore Dreiser in that exalted company, but a clinical rereading of the trilogy serves mainly to expose its many weaknesses. In its own day it was a monument, but in ours it is a period piece.</p><p>Like countless others who are now in their sixties or older, I first read Studs Lonigan (in the Modern Library "Giant" edition) when I was a teenager, about half a century ago. It was barely two decades old in the mid-1950s, and still seemed fresh, daring and original. Studs, especially the teenage Studs of Young Lonigan, was someone with whom a boy of the '50s could identify, as he struggled to break free of his loving but stifling family, as he fell into the grip of sexual confusion and longing, as shyness and peer pressure stifled his gentler, loving instincts, as he was gradually smothered by the little Chicago world into which he had been born and then by the Depression.</p><p>Reading Studs Lonigan was an immensely important experience for me, and doubtless many others reading this review would say the same. It was big, ambitious, honest and identifiably American. Even as late as the 1950s American literature was still emerging from the shadows cast by Europe and England, and writers who not merely confronted distinctly American subjects but wrote in distinctly American voices were welcomed with real gratitude and passion. The "Great American Novel" was something people still believed in, or wanted to believe in, and a lot of people thought Studs Lonigan might just be it, if not its almost exact contemporary, John Dos Passos's monumental trilogy, U.S.A.</p><p>It gives me no pleasure to report that seven decades after its publication and on its author's centennial, Studs Lonigan fails to pass one of the essential tests of greatness. Though the core of Studs's story is timeless, the specifics are forced and dated: the stilted language, the pervasive racism and anti-Semitism, the stabs at irony that rarely rise above sarcasm, the rootedness in a time and place that now seem impossibly remote. Opening the book with what can fairly be described as eagerness, I quickly -- indeed almost immediately -- found myself fighting to stay attentive and awake. I also found myself wondering how many readers under the age of 30 would have any patience with Farrell's lumbering prose or would find anything within the trilogy with which to connect.</p><p>The trilogy begins when Studs is 14 years old, preparing to graduate from secondary school, and ends with his death a decade and a half later of heart problems complicated by pneumonia. His story parallels that of his country, which before World War I and during the 1920s was optimistic but declined into despair as the Depression slowly ground hope away. Set in blue-collar Irish-American Chicago, it obviously contains many autobiographical elements, but it would be a mistake to read Studs's story as Farrell's own. Farrell pitied Studs but identified with him only to the extent that they came from the same place and were Irish Catholic. Otherwise, Farrell was clearly angered by his protagonist's passivity, his inarticulateness, his provincialism, his bigotry. The one time Farrell's own voice can be heard clearly and unmistakably comes near the halfway point, when a brief interlude is given to "a University student who had lost his religion," Danny O'Neill:</p><p>"He had been told things, told that the world was good and just, and that the good and just were rewarded, lies completely irrelevant to what he had really experienced; lies covering a world of misery, neuroticism, frustration, impecuniousness, hypocrisy, disease, clap, syphilis, poverty, injustice. . . . He wanted to be a writer. He didn't know how. He wanted to purge himself completely of the world he knew, the world of Fifty-eighth Street, with its God, its life, its lies, the frustrations he had known in it, the hates it had welled up in him. . . . It would all go in a newer, cleaner world. He seethed with sudden dizzying adolescent dreams and visions of this new world. He, too, he would destroy the old world with his pen; he would help create the new world. He would study to prepare himself. He saw himself in the future, delivering great and stirring orations, convincing people, a leader, a savior of the world." </p><p>That of course is precisely what Farrell himself tried to do. Like many other American novelists, poets and playwrights who became prominent during the Depression, he was heavily influenced by socialism and Marxism (though he was a Trotskyite rather than a Leninist, and ultimately became a Cold Warrior who voted for Richard Nixon in 1972) and wrote within the Proletarian tradition. His writing seems to have been motivated at least as much by politics and ideology as by the naturalist belief that fate is determined by environment and circumstances rather than by free will. This may have leant a certain immediacy to his work as it first appeared, but it also ensured that in the long run it would become dated.</p><p>A further difficulty with Studs Lonigan is that Studs himself is a remarkably unappealing character, or so he seems on second encounter. Reading about him as a teenager, I empathized with him, just as other teenagers of the same period empathized with Holden Caulfield. Reading about him as an adult, I found him spineless (not in street brawls, but in human connections), purposeless and self-pitying. He never amounts to anything more than "a leading member of the Fifty-eighth Street bunch," incapable of understanding his friend Helen Shires's insistence "that he was being a fool hanging around Fifty-eighth Street where the bunch made a bum out of everybody." He may be a guys' guy, but the guys are mostly riding one-way tickets to nowhere, to prison or to premature death.</p><p>He's not really stupid, but most of the time he acts so dumb you want to wring his neck. Most teenage boys will identify with his passionate longing for girls and his frustration at being unable to connect with them, but over and over again he leaves no doubt that the fault is entirely his own. He's crazy about Lucy Scanlan, and she seems to return the feeling, but just when he thinks he's reached "a turning point" with her, he blows it because "he wanted to say more, and he couldn't," and then when he sees graffiti -- "STUDS LOVES LUCY" -- he represses his tender feelings for her "because STUDS LONIGAN was an iron man, and when anybody laughed at the iron man, well, the iron man would knock the laugh off the face of Mr. Anybody with the sweetest paste in the mush that Mr. Anybody ever got." Ditto for Helen Shires and Catherine Banahan ("Studs wanted to tell Catherine that Red's wife was not as sweet nor as pretty as she was, but the words choked up on him") and all the other women to whom he is attracted. With each one eventually he begins "to become afraid of himself, of the feelings of love and tenderness," and he backs away into the macho cocoon that is the only place where he feels at home. The same goes for everything else in his life. He quits high school after one year, afraid, apparently, of its challenges and the possibility that he might fail them. He fights repeatedly with his father, but retreats into his father's painting business rather than test himself in something new. From time to time for one reason or another "Studs' conscience bothered him," but rarely for long and never with lasting effect.</p><p>It's hard not to contrast Studs with another Chicago boy, Saul Bellow's Augie March. Studs is Irish and Augie Jewish, but both come from similar circumstances. While Studs succumbs to them, Augie rises above them. While Studs is passive, Augie is positive and hopeful. Some of the difference surely can be attributed to the times in which their authors created them. Farrell wrote Studs Lonigan during a period of widespread working-class unrest and violence against organized labor, and then during the hard early years of the Depression; Bellow wrote The Adventures of Augie March in the prolonged period of optimism that followed World War II. Farrell was a dogged naturalist throughout his adult life, while Bellow emerged from that tradition to find greater strength in individual will. In sum, though both books have their flaws and are seriously dated, Augie March has far more energy, passion and humor and in spirit is more American.</p><p>It should be mentioned that there are language and sentiments in Studs Lonigan that many of today's readers will find deeply offensive. The prejudice against blacks and Jews that is repeatedly expressed in terms now regarded as unacceptable accurately reflects the time and place in which Studs lived, though it certainly is contrary to Farrell's own egalitarian views. To eliminate these words and hatreds would be to whitewash historical truth, but the prospective reader of Studs Lonigan is herewith advised to enter it with eyes wide open. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Milan Kundera calls Cervantes "the founder of the Modern Era and Lionel Trilling "observes that it can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition reproduces the acclaimed Tobias Smollett translation; as Salman Rushdie declares, "To my mind, this is the only English rendering of the Quixote that reads like a great novel, a novel of immense daring, much wildness and many colours. It releases Don Quixote from the grey academic prison of many more recent translations, unleashing him upon the English language in all his brilliant, foolish glory."

Dr. Brammer maintains a private practice specializing in gender and sexuality issues."This text is sure to be a pivotal text in the development of awareness, knowledge and skills for counselors in training. Readers looking for a comprehensive text on multicultural and diversity issues should find this text to be very helpful to their personal and professional growth."<br><br>"I like the boxed or offset personal stories and examples that are given in the text. Such examples make the text live and can illustrate the multiple identities and issues faced by clients and counselors. I think that counselors in-training will pay more attention to such case examples, since they are always looking for ways to implement multicultural counseling."</p><h2>Saxon Algebra 1, 4th Edition: Testing Book</h2><p>We are still working on filling in the product descriptions.

In these seven lectures originally presented between 1946 and 1985, a Nobel laureate in physics examines the creative process in science and shows how a sense of the beautiful is a key element. Comparing Shakespeare, Beethoven, and Newton, Chandrasekhar points out similarities and differences in artistic and scientific creativity; and in pieces on Edward Arthur Milne and Arthur Stanley Eddington, shows how the aesthetic sense guided each man's work.

McMurphy swaggers into the mental ward like a blast of fresh air and turns the place upside down, starting a gambling operation, smuggling in wine and women, and egging on the other patients to join him in open rebellion. But McMurphy's revolution against Big Nurse and everything she stands for quickly turns from sport to a fierce power struggle with shattering results.</p><p> With <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, Kesey created a work without precedent in American literature, a novel at once comic and tragic that probes the nature of madness and sanity, authority and vitality. Greeted by unanimous acclaim when it was first published, the book has become and enduring favorite of readers. </p><p></p></p><p>An international bestseller, Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest defined the 1960s era of ever-widening perspectives and ominous repressive forces. Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p><b>Ken Kesey</b> was born in 1935 and grew up in Oregon. He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962.

The book also provides a critical overview of the field of health measurement, with a technical introduction and discussion of the history and future directions for measurements in each area.<br> Eighty-eight measurements that evaluate health via questionnaires or rating scales are reviewed.. Reviews of the 50 scales included in the first edition have been updated, the original chapters have been expanded to include new methods, and two new chapters have been written. The book covers measurements of physical disability, social health, psychological well-being, depression, mental status testing, pain, general health status and quality of life. Each chapter presents a tabular comparison of the quality of the instruments. The description of each method covers its purpose and conceptual basis, its reliability and validity, and a copy of the scale is shown.<br> This book is intended as a reference work for researchers from the medical and social sciences, and for health professionals wishing to evaluate the progress of their patients. The first edition was praised for its accurate and thorough descriptions of measurement scales and for its contributions to improving the science of health measurement. It has always been used as a text in health services research courses. The second edition further strengthens these qualities.</p><p>Ian McDowell is at University of Ottawa.<br>"Indispensable for those seeking a consumer's guide to health measures....Written in an engaging and informative style....'5 stars!'(highest rating)"--<em>Doody Publishing</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Power from Steam: A History of the Stationary Steam Engine</h2><p>This is the first comprehensive history of the steam engine in fifty years.

These cleverly interwoven tales of their heart-stopping adventures take us from the feats of World War I through the heroism of World War II and beyond, including daring military raids and survival-at-sea, and will appeal to fans of <i>Unbroken</i>, <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, and <i>Flyboys</i>. With the world in peril in World War II, each man set aside great success and comfort to return to the skies for his most daring mission yet. Doolittle, a brilliant aviation innovator, would lead the daring Tokyo Raid to retaliate for Pearl Harbor; Lindbergh, hero of the first solo flight across the Atlantic, would fly combat missions in the South Pacific; and Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, would bravely hold his crew together while facing near-starvation and circling sharks after his plane went down in a remote part of the Pacific. Groom's rich narrative tells their intertwined stories--from broken homes to Medals of Honor (all three would receive it); barnstorming to the greatest raid of World War II; front-page triumph to anguished tragedy; and near-death to ultimate survival--as all took to the sky, time and again, to become exemplars of the spirit of the "greatest generation."</p><p>WINSTON GROOM is the author of 14 previous books of nonfiction and fiction, including <i>Shiloh 1862, Vicksburg 1863, Patriotic Fire</i>, <i>Shrouds of Glory</i>, <i>Forrest Gump,</i> and <i>Conversations with the Enemy </i>(with Duncan Spencer), which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist.

Professionals now rely on CAD software, rapid prototyping, and programmable logic devices to streamline the design process. Contemporary Logic Design is the first text to address these changes -- and to offer a truly modern introduction to logic design. Throughout, the author complements his presentation of logic design theory with discussions of current design technologies. Approximately 60% of the book presents new material; the remainder has been re-organized and partially re-written to correspond to the organizational changes.</p><p><p> In the decade since the first edition of this book was published, the technologies of digital design have continued to evolve. The evolution has run along two related tracks: the underlying physical technology and the software tools that facilitate the application of new devices. The trends identified in the first edition have continued and promise to continue to do so. Programmable logic is virtually the norm for digital designers and the art of digital design now requires the software skills to deal with hardware description languages. </p> <p> Hardware designers now spend the majority of their time dealing with software. Specifically, the tools needed to efficiently map digital designs onto the emerging programmable devices that are growing more sophisticated. They capture their design specifications in software with language appropriate for describing the parallelism of hardware; they use software tools to simulate their designs and then to synthesize it into the implementation technology of choice. Design time is radically reduced, as market pressures require products to be introduced quickly at the right price and performance. </p> <p> Although the complexity of designs is necessitating ever more powerful abstractions, the fundamentals remain unchanged. The contemporary digital designer must have a much broader understanding of the discipline of computation, including both hardware and software. This broader perspective is present in this second edition. </p><p> <b> <i>Randy Katz</i></b><i> </i> received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley.

But in Albert Alschuler's critique of both Justice Holmes and contemporary legal scholarship, a darker portrait is painted&#x2014;that of a man who, among other things, espoused Social Darwinism, favored eugenics, and, as he himself acknowledged, came "devilish near to believing that might makes right."</p><p>In recent decades, Oliver Wendell Homes has been praised as "the only great American legal thinker" and "the most illustrious figure in the history of American law." In <i>Law without Values</i>, Albert W. Alschuler paints a much darker picture of Justice Holmes as a distasteful man who, among other things, espoused Social Darwinism, favored eugenics, and as he himself acknowledged, came "devilish near to believing htat might makes right."<br><br>Alschuler begins by examinging Holmes's power-focused philosophy and then turns to Holmes the person, describing how the horrors he expereinced in the Civil War would transform his outlook into one of moral skepticism and profoundly color his decisions, both personal and legal. Thus skepticism, Alschuler argues, was at the root of his personal indifference to others, his romanticization of war and struggle, his persistent efforts to substitute powe metaphors for judgments of right and wrong, and his "bad man" concept of law. His pernicious leacy, according to Alschuler, is evident in twentieth-century legal thought, whether one takes an economic or a critical legal approach. Contrary to the perception of many modern lawyers and scholars, Holmes's legacy was not a "revolt against formalism" or against a priori reasoning; it was a revolt against the objective concepts of right and wrong&#x2014;against values.<br><br>Alschuler's thoroughgoing, no-holds-barred debunking of Holmes, together with his scathing critique of contemporary legal scholarship, will be a lightning rod for discussion and debate.<b>Albert W.

Thus, an appropriate way to preface this book is to talk first of its roots, its beginnings. In the mid 1980s there emerged in some quarters the sense that it was time for family studies to take stock of itself. A goal was thus set to write a book that, like Janus, would face both backward and forward a book that would give readers both a perspec tive on the past and a map for the future. There were precedents for such a project: The Handbook of Marriage and the Family edited by Harold Christensen and published in 1964; the two Contemporary Theories about theFamily volumes edited by Wesley Burr, Reuben Hill, F. Ivan Nye, and Ira Reiss, published in 1979; and the Handbook of Marriage and the Family edited by Marvin Sussman and Suzanne Steinmetz, then in production.</p><p><p>Now in softcover, the Sourcebook of Family Theories and Methods distills nearly a century of theories and therapies into one comprehensive volume. This unique sociohistorical account of family studies traces the development of various theories and methods within the sociopolitical context of the twentieth century, giving readers a practical balance of scientific and real-world perspective.</p> <p></p> <p>Contributors review each theory and method in terms of its origins, core assumptions, applications, and links to previous and successive theories and methods. Specific chapters provide in-depth applications with couples, families, step and blended families, minorities, families with histories of violence, and families facing chronic illness, as well as potential uses in policy, education, or further research. In this way, readers may find new ideas and possibilities in older or less familiar schools of thought. At the same time, the book offers the foundation for the future of the field.</p> <p></p> <p>A sampling of the coverage:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Systems theory.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Human ecology theory.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Life course perspectives.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Social-cognitive-behavioral theory.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Feminist theory.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Theories derived from family therapy.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Biosocial theory.</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Ethnomethodology.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>A historical reference that doubles as a contemporary idea book, the Sourcebook of Family Theories and Methods belongs in the libraries of family therapists and psychologists, social workers, and sociologists specializing in families. Policy analysts in this critical area should find the Sourcebook significant reading as well. </p></p><h2>Response &amp; Analysis, Second Edition: Teaching Literature in Secondary School</h2><p><p>In this fully updated second edition of <i>Response and Analysis</i>, Robert Probst leads you to fresh methods that build lifelong lovers of reading by opening your literature classroom to the power of student-driven interpretation and analysis.

UCSMP Advanced Algebra emphasizes facility with algebraic expressions and forms, especially linear and quadratic forms, powers and roots, and functions based on t hese concepts. Students study logarithmic, trigonometric, polynomial, and other special functions both for their abstract properties and as tools for modeling real-world situations. A geometry course or its equal is a prerequisite, as geometric ideas are utilized throughout. Technology for graphing and CAS technology is assumed to be available to students. Advanced Algebra can be used following any standard geometry course. Students who have studied UCSMP Geometry before this course tend to be better prepared for the transformation and coordinate geometry they will need in this course. Students who have studied UCSMP Advanced Algebra are prepared for courses commonly found at the senior level, including trigonometry and precalculus courses.

Although Halliday and Resnick's book was the textbook chosen by the Physics Department, many students were observed by the faculty to be studying from Serway's book. The students had acquired old used versions of the Serway book, and they were actively studying out of this book rather than the prescribed textbook. Serway's book became our students' popular choice. The Physics Department, recognizing this, adopted a "give them what they want" attitude, and accordingly Serway's book was made the textbook for the calculus-based undergraduate physics course."<br><br>"Some of the general things I look for are the end-of-chapter questions and problems, and the quality of explanations. Feedback from students is also important--past students have given Serway more favorable reviews...another reason we went with Serway this semester."<br><br>"Quick Quizzes are a really good component. Pitfall Preventions answered a number of my criticisms of the text. I am very pleased with the overall emphasis on conceptual understanding. I have been very pleased with Serway. I have no expectations of switching texts in the near future."<br><br>"Would I use this text for my classes, both Engineers and Honors students? I certainly would."<br><br>"Finally, I would like to add that my son is taking high school physics. He is using the non-calculus version of the text. He likes the book and he tells me that his fellow students do also."</p><h2>Cranford (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p><p>A sensitive and moving portrait of a Victorian town, captured at a transitional period in English society, <i>Cranford</i> first appeared serially in Charles Dickens's magazine <i>Household Words</i> from 1851 to 1853, and in book form in 1853. Author Elizabeth Gaskell situated her stories in a hamlet very like the one in which she grew up, and her affectionate but unsentimental portraits of the residents of <i>Cranford</i> offer a realistic view of life and manners in an English country village during the 1830s.<br><i>Cranford</i> recounts the events and activities in the loves of a group of spinsters and widows who struggle in genteel poverty to maintain their standards of propriety, decency, and kindness. Tales of the heroism and self-sacrifice of Captain Brown, the surprisingly betrothal of Lady Glenmire, and the future for pretty but poor Miss Jessie support a web of subtle but serious themes that include the movement from aristocratic to middle-class values, the separate spheres and diverse experiences of men and women, and the curious coexistence of customs old and new in a changing society.<br>Often referred to as Mrs. Gaskell, the author preferred <i>Cranford</i> to all her other works, which include a popular biography of her friend Charlotte Bront�. Praised by Charles Dickens as "delightful, and touched with the most tender and delicate manner," the novel remains a favorite with students and aficionados of nineteenth-century literature.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>Originally published as a magazine serial and then printed in novel form in 1853, Cranford is a playful tour of a peculiar country town. From the stately, stern Miss Jenkyns to the timid Miss Betsy Barker and her flannel-wearing cow, the inhabitants are all acquainted, and all poised to overhear scandal.<p> Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s episodic second novel, sometimes dismissed as nostalgically &#x201c;charming,&#x201d; is now considered by many critics to be her most sophisticated work. The country town of Cranford is home to a group of women, affectionately called &#x201c;Amazons&#x201d; by the narrator, whose seemingly uneventful lives are full of conflicts, failures, and unexpected connections. A rich commentary on Victorian culture by one of its most astute observers, <em>Cranford </em>owes its enduring popularity to the complex pleasures it offers the reader. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition provides an assortment of historical materials to put the novel in context, including Gaskell&#x2019;s letters from the period of the novel&#x2019;s writing, excerpts from texts read by the characters, illustrations from the novel and from contemporary periodicals, and other Victorian writings on industrialization, etiquette, and domestic life. </p></p><h2>Experiencing the World&#39;s Religions: Tradition, Challenge and Change</h2><p><i>Experiencing the World's Religions</i> provides a clear and compelling account of religion as a diverse, lived experience by peoples around the world. Global in its coverage, the text conveys the vitality and richness of the world's religions as a living cultural wellspring that not only concerns systems of belief but how those beliefs are expressed in ceremonies, food, clothing, art, architecture, pilgrimage, scripture, and music. The text demonstrates why an understanding of the world's religions enriches our lives. In an engaging narrative emphasizing the experience of religion, the text takes students on a personal voyage through doctrines, history, the religiously inspired arts, ceremonies, and everyday expressions of belief and combines these with powerful photographs from around the globe.

Despite massive media coverage, we know little about what drives young perpetrators or how they rationalize their acts. In this breakthrough analysis, Dr. Peter Langman presents the psychological causes of school shootings and offers unprecedented insight into why certain teens exhibit the potential to kill. He shows how to identify early signs of possible violence and offers preventative measures that parents and educators can take to protect their communities.</p></p><p>Dr. Peter Langman is a psychologist whose research on school shooters has received international recognition.

The author meets his task of truly getting into the minds of school shooters.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>BNET</i></p><p>&#x201c;Langman offers a paradigm of three specific categories of youth offenders--psychopathic, psychotic, or traumatized. . . Langman fully discusses long-term exposure to violence, genetic predisposition to violence, recurrent alienation from mainstream society, depression, narcissism, and lack of empathy, as well as improperly challenged and constrained rage in the context of these three categories . . . He also looks at cases of youth who are not as notorious and whose intent to kill others was thwarted, and ends with lessons that can be learned from these and other cases. In addition, Langman presents research that informs current practice with disconnected, enraged youth. Langman believes that school shootings can be prevented, and his analysis offers reflections on how prevention can occur. A vital, phenomenal, extremely valuable work.

Shows what we can do to make schools safe and homes friendly and child focused. Perhaps his greatest contribution is to point out that hyper reactive child exist in a social context that if it is not empathic and helpful can perhaps trigger the calamites he describes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stuart Twemblow, author of Why School Anti Bullying Programs Don't Work</i></p><p>&#x201c;We desperately need this book. It provides an interior view of the mind of rampage school shooters that helps us understand the origins of the narcissism, paranoia, sadism, and thwarted rage that appears to motivate them. Through the learned hands of Peter Langman, we come to understand the differences between shooters who are pyschopaths and those who are schizophrenics, and why these distinctions matter. A dispassionate, but clinically powerful analysis, Why Kids Kill, will be of great interest to teachers, parents, school administrators, and law enforcement officials who are responsible for prevention and treatment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Katherine S.

However, religion&#x2015;as a socially constructed world of shared meaning&#x2015;can also be compared to a fantasy role-playing game. In fact, the claims of the moral entrepreneurs, in which they presented themselves as heroes battling a dark conspiracy, often resembled the very games of imagination they condemned as evil. By attacking the imagination, they preserved the taken-for-granted status of their own socially constructed reality. Interpreted in this way, the panic over fantasy-role playing games yields new insights about how humans play and together construct and maintain meaningful worlds.<br><br> Laycock&#x2019;s clear and accessible writing ensures that <i>Dangerous Games </i>will be required reading for those with an interest in religion, popular culture, and social behavior, both in the classroom and beyond.</p><p>"Joseph P. Laycock's book delves into the minds of both avid gamers and evangelical Christians and returns with surprising and unsettling conclusions. Gaming, Laycock shows, teaches social and psychological strategies to resist cultural authority and to view reality from radically new perspectives. This book affirms the transformational power that motivates this increasingly popular activity, and thus it is essential reading for scholars of both contemporary popular culture and American religions."&#x2015;Bill Ellis, Professor Emeritus, English and American Studies, Pennsylvania State University<br><br> &#x201c;Laycock&#x2019;s book brings a robust, theoretically informed eye to a topic that has been understudied by sociologists. His case is presented in such a way that other scholars could apply his method and understanding of moral panic to other aspects of popular culture. This is a crucial aspect of scholarship. Laycock writes engagingly, tells a deft story, and advances our understanding.&#x201d;&#x2015;Doug Cowan, Professor of Religious Studies and Social Development Studies, Renison University College<br><br> &#x201c;Laycock provides an in-depth, theoretically informed analysis of fantasy role-playing games that will both help scholars interpretively and further allow instructors to provide students with a more sophisticated view of their culture. This book more broadly examines the social construction of reality, particularly religion. Laycock's approach makes a much-needed contribution to the understanding of the human need and capacity for creating and inhabiting multiple realities.

Lovecraft Short Stories</h2><p>Lovecraft&#39;s otherworldly visions of cosmic horrors, alien beings and a world not quite our own remain immensely powerful and able to terrify even the most resolute readers. The stories here span the breadth of Lovecraft&#39;s literary career, from his early forays into the Dreamlands to his mature writings in the Cthulhu mythos. This volume includes such cult classics as &#39;The Call of Cthulhu&#39;, &#39;The Whisperer in the Darkness&#39; and &#39;The Shadow over Innsmouth&#39;. Includes the favourite stories of one of America&#39;s greatest ever horror writers. The Cthulhu universe has been adapted into several different formats, including the Alone in the Dark video game series and countless movies.</p><p>H. P. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in the US in 1890. Influenced by various literary interests, first in the Tales of Arabian Nights, then Greek mythology and also gothic tales told to him by his grandfather, Lovecraft mixed these together with an interest in science and gave voice to his ideas in a series of dark tales of fantasy and horror. He suffered from ill health, at one point having a nervous breakdown, and he was unable to attend university, which was a huge disappointment to him. He died in 1937, but his legacy lives on in a body of work that has inspired countless films, TV series, board games and toys, as well as the work of many other writers.</p><h2>History of Economic Thought</h2><p>An upper-level text, History of Economic Thought continues to offer a lively, accessible discussion of ideas that have shaped modern economics.

Students of speech and rhetoric to this day study the works of Cicero for guidance. We find Roman Law setting the model for legal systems from the twelfth century to the present.

Jasper Griffin, for instance, looks to the works of Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, and Wordsworth, among others, to trace the lasting influence of the great Roman poet Virgil on the development of poetic forms such as the pastoral, epitomized by Virgil's <em>Eclogues</em>, and the epic poem, exemplified by the <em>Aeneid</em>. A.T. Grafton shows how Renaissance intellectuals such as Machiavelli and Guicciardini looked to Rome's past for political enlightenment, and found models of military strategy in the works of Tacitus and Livy. Editor Richard Jenkyns dispels the misconception of the Romans as purely imitative of the Greeks; he points out such uniquely Roman concepts as jurisprudence and citizenship, and architecture based on the round arch and the vault, as evidence of Roman innovativeness. Other contributors--George A. Kennedy, Robert Feenstra, and Nicholas Purcell--discuss the importance of the study of Roman rhetoric in preparing speakers for public life, the lasting influence of the Justinian code on Western legal development, and the impact on future civilizations of the romanticized notion of an imperial Rome and its magical ruins.<br> Ranging from the pastoral tradition, to the development of the comedy, to the lasting influence of the Latin language, <em>The Legacy of Rome</em> provides a much-needed new appraisal of the richness of the great civilization which gave rise to a large part of Western heritage.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br><strong>Richard Jenkyns is a Fellow and Tutor in Classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.</strong><br>`handsome collection of essays ... here there is palpable treasure ...

Covering over two dozen fern and half a dozen gymnosperm families, they survey fern species of both ecological and horticultural importance and review such gymnosperm taxa as the conifers--the dominant trees in many forests as well as important timber plants--and cycads, which display significant evolutionary features. In all, the volume assembles 509 species of ferns and fern allies and infraspecific taxa in 70 genera. The editors have revised nearly 80 of these taxa to reflect classification changes since publication of the last standard work on ferns in North America. The gymnosperm treatments encompass 118 species in 22 genera. Identification keys, summaries of habitats and geographic ranges, pertinent synonymies, descriptions, chromosome numbers, and all other significant details are provided. More than 600 distribution maps and 65 illustration plates appear throughout.<br></p><p>The Editorial Committee of the Flora of North America (FNA) is responsible for the authoritative, multivolume work describing the native plants of North America.<br>"The second volume of this flora represents a monumental achievement....This volume does everything that a flora should - and more; a high quality of scholarship is evident throughout....Even more important is the degree to which recent systematic investigations are reflected in the treatments....This volume has set a high standard; it will serve as an excellent model for later volumes....The real 'review' of a flora comes in putting it to use, and I am looking forward to using this one!

But how do our different individual realities merge and combine...in Seth's words... 'to form mass reactions such as the overthrow of governments, the birth of a new religion, wars, epidemics, earthquakes, and new periods of art, architecture, and technology'?<br><br>Now Seth pinpoints the unconscious (and often negative) beliefs pervading science and religion, medicine and mythology. He discusses the psychological underpinnings of world leaders like Hitler and Nixon and the dynamics of 'mass events' like Jonestown and Three Mile Island. Whole groups of individuals often choose to die together so that 'their deaths amount to a mass statement'... for according to Seth, quality of life and not survival is any species' basic goal. Dying is a psychological necessity, for after a while, the exuberant energies of the spirit can no longer be translated into flesh.'<br><br>Here too, Seth clarifies how to change our world for the better and live in it 'not only as loving caretakers, but as partners with other species.' For the first time, he begins a discussion of Framework 2...'the source of your world,' a level of higher reality where all positive goals are worked out... and how it translates into and manifests as Framework 1, the everyday life we know.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to the Theory of Stellar Structure and Evolution</h2><p>Using fundamental physics, the theory of stellar structure and evolution can predict how stars are born, how their complex internal structure changes, what nuclear fuel they burn, and their ultimate fate.

An expert on later Chinese painting, he is the recipient of numerous academic honors. He lives in Palo Alto, California.</p><p><b>PREFACE</b></p> <p> <i>Chinese Art &amp; Culture</i> is a refreshingly clear look at the oldest and most productive continuous artistic tradition on earth. From 7,000-year-old Neolithic pot-making and jade-carving cultures to contemporary artists' installation, video, and performance pieces, this engrossing survey embraces the richness and complexity of Chinese art and supports its teaching in the college classroom. </p> <p> In all the right ways, this is a different kind of book on Chinese art. Departing from the predictable narration of dynasties and styles, author-scholars Robert L. Thorp and Richard Ellis Vinograd present art as a cultural expression of societal expectations, politics, material culture, belief systems, and wider fields of culture. They emphasize works of ancient art and architecture found in their original archaeological settings. Where that is not feasible, they reconstruct interconnections among individual pieces and with their contexts of production. To the broad cultural picture, they add considerations of the material of which an object is made and the distinctive techniques used to make it. Thus an early Ming vase is shown as the product of a new advance in firing technology that enabled control of copper red glazes and as a reflection&#x2014;in its shape&#x2014;of the lingering taste of the Early Ming emperors for things Tibetan. </p> <p> Chinese art is one of the most active and mutable areas of cultural scholarship today. Thorp and Vinograd are leaders in a generation of scholars who are re-examining long-held conceptions about Chinese art&#x2014;for example, the notion that Chinese art has essential and permanent characteristics and the idea that Chinese art and culture were untouched by outside influences. just as important, the authors give popular, religious, and craft arts their just due. Richly illustrated-some of the objects have almost never been pictured before-and enhanced with special-topic sidebars, this long-awaited book answers the needs of students and teachers of Chinese art for a work that is current in approach and scholarship and is at the same time reader-friendly. </p></p><h2>Century 21 South-Western Accounting, General Journal</h2><p>No other accounting text takes you further or gives you more.

He lives in Jackson Hole,&nbsp;Wyoming.<p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In 1992, a 22-year-old undergrad dropped out of college to launch his own business. He wanted to be his own boss and decided to build a company selling health products. His sisters told him he was a &#x201c;*$%*&amp;^@&#x201d; idiot, and his befuddled parents asked him softly if he wouldn&#x2019;t rather finish his degree first. But he was committed to make this, his first real attempt at formally building a business, a massive success. He bought the wholesale rights to a line of health products and invested his life savings ($3,200) in stocking inventory and setting up a small office, then spent long hours marketing the line, personally posting thousands of flyers and making hundreds of sales calls.</p><p>Eight months later, the business had failed; his family graciously never said &#x201c;<i>I told you so</i>.&#x201d; But the story doesn&#x2019;t end there. The good ones never do.</p><p>After taking some time to lick his wounds and salve his bruised ego, our now 25-year-old recent college grad made another go in a totally different business. His earlier failure had taught him some crucial lessons (including a sorely needed dose of humility). Cataloging his talents and interests, he decided on a new industry&#x2014;info-marketing. He made a list of the top ten business leaders in this industry and approached each one, asking for the opportunity to interview them about how they had built such successful companies, and asking for any advice they could give to someone just starting out. Initially, these big players ignored him, but he was persistent, hounding them until he finally got eight of the ten to meet with him. In their interviews, these leaders spoke candidly about the lessons they had gleaned after decades in the business world, climbing the same peaks our young businessman wanted to scale. He took their advice to heart, following up on skills and topics they said he would have to understand to be successful. He read dozens of business books and made a study of how to successfully build a business.</p><p>Eight years later, he was an &#x201c;overnight&#x201d; success, the owner of one of the top real estate training companies in the United States, having trained more than 50,000 investors who went on to buy and sell over $1 billion of properties. With no debt or outside investors, his company generated over $3 million of annual operating profit and was valued at $10 million to $16 million. After he sold this company, he went on to found and build half a dozen other successful companies, each time leveraging the lessons and experiences from his earlier businesses.</p><p>In 2009 a mutual friend introduced him to a business superstar&#x2014;a guy who had helped launch and grow one of the fastest-scaling companies of all time, Priceline.com, which had grown from $0 in sales to over $1 billion <i>in less than four years</i>. When the two of them met in Atlanta, they talked for hours, realizing they had a lot in common&#x2014;especially their shared passion for mentoring and coaching other business owners. One had built several multimillion-dollar companies and personally trained more than 100,000 business owners; the other helped build a multi<i>billion</i>-dollar company that revolutionized an industry. But they both loved coaching and mentoring business owners to scale their companies.</p><p>You may have already guessed that the college dropout turned successful entrepreneur was David, and the Priceline.com superstar was Jeff. Like David, Jeff launched his first start-up, a software company, while still in college. Unlike David, Jeff and his team nailed it with their first company, which they later sold to American Express for millions. Priceline.com was actually Jeff&#x2019;s fifth start-up, and after the company went public and Jeff transitioned out of the business, he went on to be the CEO of uBid.com and RedTag.com. He even launched a very successful entertainment company, Black Sky Entertainment, which went on to generate over $100 million in sales.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve both lived the life of serial entrepreneurs, not just launching companies, but leading them through those all-important middle years when a business must either stay stuck as an extension of the founder, or scale and grow independent of the owner. Over the years, we&#x2019;ve grown our friendship and shared the stage teaching at various business conferences. During that time, we came to realize that we shared a complementary skill set and approach to growing companies. And we also learned that we had shared experiences of those scary, absorbing, and exciting years when these businesses began to grow at triple-digit rates or faster. We joked that at times it felt like we were on the back of a rodeo bull, holding on with all our might, praying for that eight-second buzzer to sound. The thing we discovered is that whereas in the rodeo those eight seconds are literal, in your business the buzzer doesn&#x2019;t go off for <i>years.</i></p><p>We also realized that we shared a frustration with the existing business books that addressed scaling a company. Too many told readers what to do, but didn&#x2019;t have the details on <i>how</i> to do the what to do. That&#x2019;s why we decided to pool our years of experiences to write this book. We wanted to put in one place a structured, systematic approach not just to create growth, but, more important, to show you how to survive and enjoy that growth by leveraging the systems, team, and internal controls necessary to sustain that development over the long term. Following this methodology, not only do you get growth in sales and profits, but you&#x2019;ll also enjoy increased freedom as the business owner. You can build a company that is stable, vibrant, valuable, <i>and</i> a joy to own. This book contains the guiding principles and the concrete formulas you can apply to consistently create the dual results of business growth and personal freedom.</p><p>We are primarily serial entrepreneurs, not authors. We love building businesses, and have been fortunate to enjoy some big successes, and to have survived the stupid, messy mistakes that, looking back, were both predictable and avoidable. While we wouldn&#x2019;t trade our paths, we wanted to catalog and share our real-world lessons about how to do it better, smarter, and faster. This is the book we <i>wished</i> we had read when we were struggling to grow our earlier businesses.</p><p>Everything you read here has been tested and validated. It is proven to work; we&#x2019;ve used it to build more than a dozen successful companies with combined sales in the billions. More important, over the past ten years, we&#x2019;ve taught these ideas to more than 100,000 business owners around the world, and the results they&#x2019;ve gotten have proved the concepts, strategies, and tools are transferable and get results. We wrote it so that you can read any chapter, put down the book, and immediately apply several of the key ideas the very next day in your business&#x2014;generating immediate results.</p><p>The ultimate goal for a business owner is to build a company that he or she can one day sell, continue to scale, or even own passively. Most business owners reach for growth by working harder and personally trying to produce more. This is a flawed model that at best will lead to only moderate growth. At worst, this strategy can literally put your entire company at risk.</p><p>Instead, we will introduce you to the Level Three Road Map, a comprehensive model for building and scaling your business. Essentially the Level Three Road Map will help you go from a Level One business (a start-up), through Level Two (an owner-reliant company), to Level Three (a rapid growth or &#x201c;exit stage&#x201d; company).</p><p>The bottom line is that scaling your company and reaching the ambitious goals that you really want requires that you move beyond an &#x201c;owner-reliant&#x201d; business to one that is systems driven, with a solid management team and intelligent business controls in place&#x2014;a Level Three business.</p><p>Overview of the Book</p><p>First and foremost, this is a book about rapid growth, and how you can build a scalable business that not only consistently grows, but also sustains that growth over time. What you&#x2019;ll come to learn is that a direct by-product of building your business the right way is that you&#x2019;ll get your life back. It is a broken model that says you must work 80-hour weeks and sacrifice everything to grow your company.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t have to choose between your business and your life. Rather, if you do it right, you get your business <i>and</i> your life. In fact, we strongly believe that the only way to build a truly scalable business is by radically reducing its reliance on you, the owner, and supporting that rapid growth through systems, team, and internal business controls.</p><p>Part one of the book focuses on building a solid foundation. You&#x2019;ll learn the essence of the Level Three Road Map. This structured formula to scale your company not only will help you create and sustain rapid growth, but at the same time will help you dramatically reduce the company&#x2019;s reliance on you. It closes with a simple tool to help you clarify your business context&#x2014;the market you serve, the competition you face, and the position you want to claim in the market. We&#x2019;ll approach all three of these key dimensions of your business context in a radically different way than it&#x2019;s likely you have ever done before.</p><p>In part two, you&#x2019;ll identify the fastest leverage points to grow your company and how to turn those leverage points into a winning business strategy. What&#x2019;s more, we&#x2019;ll give you our step-by-step process to create a clear, actionable, one-page plan for executing your strategy on a rolling, 90-day basis. You&#x2019;ll also learn how to read the rapidly changing world around you in order to continually keep your business fresh and relevant to the marketplace.</p><p>In part three, we&#x2019;ll walk you through how to overcome the predictable obstacles to scaling, pillar by pillar. From lead generation to lead conversion, operations, finance, HR, and leadership, we&#x2019;ll give you proven solutions to dozens of the toughest challenges you&#x2019;ll face as you scale your company. You&#x2019;ll learn how to build &#x201c;expert systems&#x201d; to pull out the key know-how that currently is locked in the heads of a few, expensive employees and replicate that expertise in scalable systems; systematically grow your sales; manage your cash flow; fund your growth; and create a culture of accountability inside your company.</p><p>In part four, you&#x2019;ll find out how to leverage your time to scale your company. We&#x2019;ll give you a brand-new model to think about time, and six simple time mastery strategies that will help you upgrade eight hours a week of time you are <i>already</i> working for higher and better uses to grow your company. We&#x2019;ll also give you a clear plan to implement the ideas from the book in a manageable way.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re a small, 3-person retailer doing $350,000 a year in sales, or a 22-person service business with annual sales of $2.5 million a year, or even a 255-person manufacturing company with $26 million a year in sales, this book will give you clear, actionable insights to grow and scale your company. Not only will the systems we share help you sustain long-term success, but you&#x2019;ll also see fast results.</p><p>The road map we&#x2019;ve laid out for you to follow will enable you to scale your company the way you&#x2019;ve always dreamed you could. We hope you&#x2019;ll reach out to us after you read this book, and share your own stories of success.

I&#x2019;m reasonably intelligent and self-motivated. I&#x2019;m willing to put in the work to grow it, I just need the right road map to show me the best path to grow my company and get my life back.</p><p>&#x2014;Comment by anonymous business owner at recent conference</p><p></p><p></p><p>PRINCIPLE ONE</p><p>BUILD A BUSINESS, NOT A JOB</p><p>The year was 2007 and Tom was burning out. He was running a successful wholesaling business in Florida, but the 80-hour workweeks were getting to be too much. He had two young kids at home whom he wasn&#x2019;t seeing enough, and he felt torn between the demands of the business and being present with the important people in his life.</p><p>And if Tom was tired, so was his wife, Lee. She was tired of Tom missing out on family dinners, not being more involved in family activities, and of watching Tom&#x2019;s long hours impact his health.</p><p>Tom and Lee knew they needed to find a way to get out from under the crushing pressures of running the business day-to-day, but they didn&#x2019;t know how. Nor did they want to lose the momentum in the business. They felt the same way so many of us do&#x2014;trapped by our business, like Atlas, holding the world on our shoulders, afraid to take a step back to reevaluate our position for fear that the whole thing could come crashing down around us. We dream of a way to grow our businesses without sacrificing our lives. But for Tom and Lee, as for a lot of us, it just wasn&#x2019;t obvious <i>how</i> to do this.</p><p>So Lee went online to research potential solutions. That&#x2019;s when she learned about a business workshop we were hosting in Arizona to raise money for several nonprofit charities.1 The goal of this workshop was to teach business owners how to design their businesses both for growth and for reducing their reliance on the owner. Lee wanted to encourage Tom to continue to grow the business but to do so in a way that allowed him to spend more time with the family and didn&#x2019;t take such a harsh toll on his health. She bought him a ticket to the event and arranged his travel.</p><p>That workshop taught Tom many of the same tools, strategies, and principles that you&#x2019;ll be learning in this book. When Tom returned home, he immediately began implementing what he had learned and watched as his business blossomed. He also saw his family and his personal life bloom as well, since he finally learned how to manage them both together. Our goal in this book is to help you achieve that same balance of business growth and personal freedom.</p><p>Prior to the workshop, Tom thought his business needed him to oversee each and every detail.

Leon Edel, James' highly-acclaimed award-winning biographer, and Lyall H. Powers, critic and editor of James' letters to Edith Wharton, have assembled and edited this definitive volume.<br> It contains the nine scribbler-notebooks originally published by Oxford in 1947, with considerable updating and annotations that both correct the identification of stories developed by James from his various notes and reveal many noted Victorians whom he concealed through the use of initials. Edel and Powers have also restored certain previously omitted portions of the notebooks, as well as including over 20,000 words of new material. This new material consists of a series of James' pocket diaries in which, amid appointments and luncheon dates, he jotted down observations and ideas for his fiction and commented on his personal relations. They also provide some fugitive dictated notes, in which James offered an autobiographical meditation on the "turning point" in his life and the "working out" of a story based on a passion murder by an American aquaintance in the south of France.<br> That's not all; Edel and Powers also give us James' long out-of-print statements for his unfinished novels <em>The Ivory Tower</em> and <em>The Sense of the Past</em>, scenarios for unfinished plays, notes on his "cash accounts," and the writer's deathbed dictation, as well as a long outline of <em>The Ambassadors</em> and jacket cover notes now identified as James' own writing. An appendix provides a substantial, and previously unpublished, fragment of <em>Hugh Merrow</em>, a story he never completed. Through all these collected writings never intended for the public eye, we see the artist at work. His private prayers to his Muse and exhortations to himself make for exhilarating reading.</p><p><br><em>About the Editors</em>:<br> <strong>Leon Edel</strong> is the author of <em>Life of Henry James</em> which received numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Arts and Letters.<br> <strong>Lyall H.

The book relates how science first struggled to find a place in the school curriculum and recounts the many debates over the years about what that curriculum should be. In fact, many of what we consider modern ideas in science education are not new at all but can be traced to writings on education of one hundred years ago. The book is aimed at all those interested in science education: classroom teachers and science education leaders concerned about the historical justification of the goals and strategies proposed for the field. The book should be enjoyed not only by the researcher but also by anyone curious about just how curriculum is decided upon and implemented on a national scale.</p></p><p><p><em>&#x201c;This is without question the finest book of its kind on the market.

In addition to Treasure Island, he also wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Kidnapped, A Child&#x2019;s Garden of Verses, and numerous other books and short stories. He passed away at age 44 in the Samoan Islands.Grade 6-8?Published first in Samoan in 1891, this story is suffused with the magic of Polynesian culture. Keawe, a native Hawaiian, comes upon the wealthy but downcast owner of a magic bottle. His fortune comes from a demon that lives in the bottle and gives its owner anything he desires. There is a catch, of course. The owner must sell it for less than he paid or "burn in hell forever." Being young and adventurous, Keawe buys it for $50, and his wishes are granted. In addition, he sells the bottle to a friend who is fully aware of the stipulations it carries. Keawe then meets and falls in love with the beautiful Kokua, but now his circumstances take a dreadful turn for he discovers a spot of leprosy on his flesh. To reverse this condition, he seeks out the bottle imp, and he finally traces it to a man who has purchased it for two cents. The horror of Keawe's dilemma is plain; if he buys the bottle for a penny he will be unable to sell it again, and he will loose his soul. Yet his love for Kokua is so great that he makes the purchase. This transaction sets the stage for events that follow. Told with all the elegance of Stevenson's style, the story is enriched by Mair's opaque watercolors that recall the work of Paul Gauguin. Her primitive style and brilliant colors add to the tension of the story and evoke the lush environs of the setting. Older readers who enjoy horror stories but are ready for something challenging will surely find this spooky tale satisfying.?Barbara Kiefer, Teachers College, Columbia University, NY<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Microsoft Office 365: A Skills Approach, 2019 Edition</h2><p><p><b>Overview</b></p><p><i>Microsoft� Office Skills on Demand!</i></p><p></p><p><b>Microsoft� Office 365/2019: A Skills Approach</b>&nbsp;provides a unique approach to learning Office Suite by isolating skills for customized learning.

The authors' tactics for brining about change reflect an interest in making treatment efficient and measuring it in terms of weeks rather than months.<p>The authors, pioneers in the field of brief strategic therapy, build on sixteen years and refining their approach at the Brief Therapy Center of the Mental Research Institute, Palo Alto.</p><p>The book opens with a concise explanation of the authors' conception of human problems-how they begin, why they persist, and how they can be resolved quickly. It then goes on to discuss all the basic elements of treatment: maintaining control, setting the stage for treatment, conducting the first interview, assessing the patient's position or point of view, planning overall treatment strategy, using specific intervention, and terminating treatment. In a long and detailed section, the authors examine situation that frequently arise during the course of treatment and provide extensive examples of what therapists can do, say, suggest, and imply to initiate beneficial change.</p><p>Case studies with commentary explaining the reasons for the therapist's actions, illustrate successful uses of techniques and further clarify the approach. The book concludes with a summary of the basic principles of brief therapy and their potential application to many kinds of human problems.<br></p><b>RICHARD FISCH</b>, is director of the Brief Therapy Center in Palo Alto, California, which he cofounded in 1966.

The book also includes lucid explanations of the metric system, Roman numerals, and other classification systems and exercises aimed at reinforcing each chapter's lesson. A section deals with Greek and Latin in the development of specialized nomenclature in science, medicine, law, and the arts.<p>Also available:</p><p>Words and Ideas - ISBN 0865164851<br>A Short Guide to Classical Mythology - ISBN 086516309X</p><p>For over 30 years Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers has produced the highest quality Latin and ancient Greek books. From Dr. Seuss books in Latin to Plato's <i>Apology</i>, Bolchazy-Carducci's titles help readers learn about ancient Rome and Greece; the Latin and ancient Greek languages are alive and well with titles like Cicero's <i>De Amicitia</i> and <i>Kaegi's Greek Grammar</i>. We also feature a line of contemporary eastern European and WWII books. </p><p> Some of the areas we publish in include: </p><p> Selections From The Aeneid<br> Latin Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Greek Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Texts Supporting Wheelock's Latin<br> Classical author workbooks: Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Catullus, Cicero<br> Vocabulary Cards For AP Selections: Vergil, Ovid, Catullus, Horace<br> Greek Mythology<br> Greek Lexicon<br> Slovak Culture And History</p></p><p>There is no doubt that the scientific vocabulary in English and other languages has increased enormously with every advance of modern science and technology, and this is in addition to the technical vocabulary for non-scientific discourse and disciplines.<p>Richard Krill's <i>Greek and Latin in English Today</i> is clear evidence that help is available for those who would like to find a way to master this very necessary vocabulary which is in great part derived from Greek and Latin. Dr. Richard Krill, who is Professor of Classics and Humanities and Chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages at the University of Toledo, has put together a valuable handbook to introduce students and others 'to a concentrated study of important Greek and Latin roots commonly found in English vocabulary and to set forth for their benefit the basic principles upon which new words are coined annually even to this day from these ancient languages. The primary purpose of this text is to assist in these efforts' (preface). This book is not a classical languages textbook but it is a book that will familiarize the students with some very necessary Greek and Latin that will enable them to master technical vocabulary in a variety of fields more easily, including literature and the arts, medicine, law, philosophy, theology, botany, zoology, astronomy, pharmacy, chemistry, psychology, sociology, government, and education.</p><p>Real Greek and Latin are presented in their complete, natural and original form. More detailed vocabularies of selected fields are included in a special section. There is a wide variety of exercises for the student to practice with at the end of each chapter, and it is obvious that the user of this book will also need a hefty and reliable English dictionary with etymologies.</p><p>The three principal parts of Krill's work embrace (1) Derivatives from Greek (with a General Greek Vocabulary); (2) Derivatives from Latin (with a General Latin Vocabulary); (3) Derivatives/Phrases in Selected Fields (including mottoes, degree titles, educational terms, and time expressions). The book uses a graded, incremental approach to building English vocabulary, while at the same time encouraging the student to learn elements and structures derived from ancient Greek and Latin. Krill's book has already actually been successfully tested with hundreds of students in real classroom situations in a number of major universities and is now being made available to a much wider audience. In June 1991 cassettes will be circulated by which students can hear proper pronunciation of the Greek and Latin words and their English derivatives.</p><p><i>Greek and Latin in English Today</i> is a very serious attempt to offer a practical handbook for the use of Greek and Latin in English. Though some will be able to use the book without a competent teacher, most will need a classically trained instructor to get the most out of this book, which will surely replace all previous books on the subject for some time to come. --John E.

Teaching reading and writing together requires more than just combining separate reading and writing pedagogies. This textbook helps students read from a writer's point of view and write with an imagined reader ever present. It introduces the importance of emotional intelligence, problem solving, metacognition, and self-advocacy. The students integrate skills and are challenged to develop literacy skills by engaging in real-world projects. By developing their skills in this context, students acquire the literacy skills they need to pass challenging college-level courses.<br>In addition to integrating and accelerating instruction, the pedagogy embeds content designed to foster the emotional intelligence development, metacognition, and problem-solving skills students often lack, yet which are correlated with higher grade point averages and a greater capacity to learn.<br>Upper-level projects feature four readings on specific topics and require students to read and analyze the selections and then integrate them effectively in their own source-based, documented essay. Purpose-oriented projects keep students interested and motivated. The handbook puts a strong emphasis on sentence combining and grammar in context.&nbsp;<br>The logical and clear framework presented in Common Places provides an abundance of models that help build students' confidence in their ability to master specific skills as they work through the chapters and the projects. Students are able to model behavior based on the features included in the chapters. The text employs several strategies to help students master the skills of reading and writing in an integrated fashion:�Scaffolded instruction presents reading and writing processes from the ground up.�Students are prompted to think their way through the steps the text provides, not just follow them.�Students are guided to select and combine patterns of development that fit writing purposes-informing, analyzing, evaluating, and persuading.�Sentence combining helps students develop true grammatical competency.&nbsp;�High-interest readings of various lengths from a variety of sources are analyzed for Lexile level.�Graphics replace dense sections of text and gradually transition to text.�Chapters include a variety of methods to inform, engage, and increase skills, such as a fictional student and a new theme on fast food.�LearnSmart Achieve offers an adaptive, individualized learning experience to teach reading and writing skills in tandem, targeting students' particular strengths and weaknesses.�Instructors may add the Grammar and Mechanics Handbook from Common Ground, the lower-level text in this program.�Common Places and Connect Integrated Reading and Writing (a state-of-the-art learning technology product) provide a cohesive instructional framework to accelerate college readiness.&nbsp;<br>New to This Edition�A new introduction to the projects section provides the step-by-step process a hypothetical student uses to complete a project, giving students a specific example of how to complete a project from start to finish with easy-to-follow steps.&nbsp;�Emotional intelligence is given an in-depth focus throughout the second edition, helping students relate elements of their development to their personal growth outside the classroom.�Features like Thinking from an Instructor's Point of View exercises enable students to develop multiple points of view.</p><p>Lisa Hoeffner earned a Ph.D. in English with a specialization in rhetoric from the University of Houston.

Beginning with the title questions, the simple, conversational texts go on to present various facets of the lives of the featured animals. As newly hatched butterflies, readers are reassured, "Your wings are crumpled. They look terrible. Don't worry." As spiders, they are warned, "If you catch a wasp in your web, don't try to eat it." Ultimately, readers are returned to human childhood and given a couple of pages of extra data about their fanciful incarnations. The softly colored, realistic illustrations depict caterpillars/butterflies and spiderlings/spiders going about their daily lives, keeping step with the text, and the focus comes back to a group of children at the close. Small carps-the butterflies have a pair of parents; the spiders only a mother. Neither species is identified, and some spiders do not spin elaborate webs. These titles are somewhat reminiscent of Mick Manning's equally engaging A Ruined House (1996) and Karen Wallace's Red Fox (1994, both Candlewick). Readers will find Butterfly and Spider comforting and helpful, with touches of humor scattered throughout.<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Butterflies through Binoculars: A Field Guide to the Boston-New York-Washington Region</h2><p>For decades, bird watchers have delighted in the freedom and joy of nature armed only with binoculars and a good field guide. In more recent years, amateur naturalists have also turned their lenses to the world of butterflies, whose myriad species and fantastic shapes and colors offer an intriguing challenge to even the most seasoned birder. But while bird enthusiasts have always had the help of accurate and accessible handbooks, those observing butterflies have had no such advantage. Until now, that is.<br> In this unique field guide, Jeffrey Glassberg has made butterfly watching a less frustrating and far more rewarding pastime, showing us how to find, identify, and enjoy the nearly 160 species that inhabit the Northeast. <em>Butterflies Through Binoculars</em> is the first butterfly guide to combine the immediacy and vividness of actual photographs of <em>living</em> butterflies with the traditional field guide format. While older guides cater to the collector, offering drawings that show the captured and mounted insect, this book shows butterflies in their natural poses and in the correct size relationship to related species. With <em>Butterflies Through Binoculars</em> in hand, the brilliant Tiger Swallowtail, the more dour Mourning Cloak, even the Rare Skipper itself will not elude identification by the beginning--or, for that matter, the more seasoned--observer. By focussing the guide on the Boston to Washington corridor, Glassberg has excluded the species from unrelated areas that have made older field guides so cumbersome. In addition, he provides entirely new field marks for butterfly identification, demonstrates how to identify subjects by way of the key characteristics butterflies are likely to display in their natural settings, shows how species can be recognized both from above and below, and explains how to differentiate between males and females.<br> Besides being a handy guide to identification, <em>Butterflies Through Binoculars</em> also tells readers where to find particular species, giving a complete account of flight times, ranges, and seasonal patterns. Nine major locations for butterflying are described in great detail, and readers are directed to forty specific locations where uncommon--even rare--species can be found. And throughout the book, the basic natural history of each species is considered in a lively, readable fashion.<br> For butterfly enthusiasts, for bird watchers who want to add a new dimension to their hobby, for anyone who is simply interested in exploring the wilds of their own back yard, <em>Butterflies Through Binoculars</em> will offer hours of delightful help and instruction.</p><p><br><strong>Dr. Jeffrey Glassberg</strong> is President of the North American Butterfly Association and editor of <em>American Butterflies</em> magazine.<br>"Butterflies Through Binoculars helped establish the hobby, giving it the type of text long available to birdwatchers."--New Age Journal<br><br>"A must for butterfly fans....[A] terrific new field guide.... It covers the Northeast, and indeed, it covers 80 percent of the species found east of the Mississippi....Offers 300 sharp color plates, field descriptions that identify the insects by their common (not Latin) names, new field<br>marks for identification and offers checklists for a number of likely sites in the Boston-Washington corridor where many species may be found....A valuable book for anyone who wonders what that butterfly he just spotted might be called....Altogether a welcome addition to the carry-along library most<br>nature lovers seem to accumulate."--Michael Levy, The Buffalo News<br><br>"The first of its kind. Never before has a butterfly field guide concentrated on field marks that can be seen on free-living butterflies....There is much to be appreciated about this book. It is well made and will stand up against the torturous conditions required of an often-used field<br>guide. The photographs are clear and large enough to extract the information needed at a glance....If you judge the value of a field guide by how well it works in the field, then Butterflies through Binoculars is a clear winner....Whatever your interest is in butterflies, there is room in your<br>backpack for this field guide. For those that have not yet explored the world of 'the wild flowers that fly' I earnestly recommend this book."--Richard L. Orr, The Audubon Naturalist<br><br>"An almost perfect butterfly identification guide....The photographs are mostly first-rate...and portray the butterflies in natural positions in the field. Believe it or not, this is a practically revolutionary idea in regional field guides....A book of this nature was long overdue. I hope<br>that current generations of butterfly enthusiasts will get it and carry it into the field at every opportunity."--Brian Cassie, North American Butterfly Association Newsletter<br><br>"A user-friendly guide that focuses on the most accessible localities, narrows the species list to a likely few, tells you how to identify them with the kind of key characters living butterflies are most likely to display, and offers the basic natural history of each species in turn....[A]<br>welcome new field guide."--E.O. Wilson, from the Foreword<br><br>"There is much to be learned and enjoyed, and this book and a pair of binoculars are the keys that unlock the world of butterflies."--Robert Robbins, from the Preface<br><br>"Will stimulate increased interest in butterfly watching and conservation.

Intolerant of political dissent, he was eventually overthrown by the very people whose loyalty he so desperately sought.

Milani's detailed and richly nuanced narrative enables us to understand why the "modernizing monarch" so disastrously failed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stephen Greenblatt, author of Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare</i></p></p><h2>Pre-Algebra, Homework Practice Workbook (MERRILL PRE-ALGEBRA)</h2><p>The Homework Practice Workbook contains two worksheets for every lesson in the Student Edition.

Most computer science texts will begin with a section on the history of computers followed with a flurry of definitions that are just &#34;so many words&#34; to the average student. The approach here is to first give the student some experience upon which to hang the definitions that come later. The usual practice of introducing classes and objects is deferred until the student has a firm grasp of the fundamentals (loops, decision structures, etc). Thus, the beginning student is not overwhelmed by the simultaneous introduction of OOPs and the fundamentals. The book includes plenty of exercises (many in &#34;contest&#34; form), programming projects, and a huge appendix.</p><p></p><h2>The Development of Western Music: A History.Third Edition</h2><p>Stolba offers a chronological presentation of the sweep of Western music and its composers, beginning with the music of antiquity and proceeding to the 20th Century.

But one great Cheyenne chief, Black Kettle, understood that the whites could not be stopped. To save his people, he worked unceasingly to establish peace and avoid bloodshed. Yet despite his heroic efforts, the Cheyennes were repeatedly betrayed and would become the victims of two notorious massacres, the second of which cost Black Kettle his life. In this first biography of black Kettle, historian Thom Hatch at last gives us the full story of this illustrious Native American leader, offering an unforgettable portrait of a chief who sought peace but found war.<br> <br> Praise For Thom Hatch<br> <br> The Blue, the Gray, and the Red<br> <br> "Clear and even-handed. . . . This popular history recounts grim, bloody, lesser-known events of the Civil War. . . .

Their names ring down through history as symbols of noble defiance against overwhelming odds. These great warrior chiefs challenged the might of the U.S. Army in desperate and doomed attempts to end white encroachment on their land and preserve their traditional ways of life. We honor their memories not for their success, but for their courage. There was another great chief, no less courageous, who believed that the only way to save his people was by waging peace instead of war. His name was Black Kettle. <p>This is the first biography of one of the most intriguing figures in the history of the American West. It traces the life of Black Kettle from the days of his youth, when he proved his courage and leadership skills in battles against enemy tribes, through his elevation to chief of the Cheyennes&#x2013;and his realization that, for the good of his people, he must become a statesman rather than a warrior. It documents his ceaseless efforts to achieve just treaties with the United States, even in the face of death threats from members of his own tribe, and describes his ultimate betrayal by the very authorities with whom he struggled to make peace. Black Kettle survived one betrayal, the notorious Sand Creek Massacre, but the controversial battle at Washita Creek four years later cost him his life.</p> <p>This fascinating journey through the life of Black Kettle and the early days of the Cheyennes explores the social, political, cultural, and historical factors that shaped every interaction between the Cheyennes and white settlers. Author Thom Hatch analyzes important treaties, examines race relations in the nineteenth-century American West, and recreates the battles and the massacres that marked the Cheyennes&#x2019; rise and fall. He also takes a fascinating look at tribal histories and customs and presents a memorable cast of characters, both famous and lesser-known, who played a role in shaping the frontier at this crucial time in history.</p> <p>Complete with sixteen stunning period photos and more than a dozen helpful maps of Cheyenne territory, Black Kettle tells a compelling and tragic story that is essential to understanding the history of the Plains Indians and the truth about how the West was lost by Native American tribes.</p>THOM HATCH, a former film and video writer, director, and producer, is the author of five previous books, including The Blue, the Gray, and the Red: Indian Campaigns of the Civil War.

Shakespeare based his play on myths of an early Celtic king of Britain, incorporating historical elements from classical Rome and Renaissance Italy. With a cast that includes an evil stepmother, scheming suitor, and devoted lovers, the drama is heightened by duels, kidnappings, and disguised identities.<br><i>Cymbeline</i> offers captivating storytelling that's crowned by the beauty of its language. Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, Samuel Beckett, and countless others have quoted Act IV's funeral song: "Fear no more the heat o' th' sun/Nor the furious winter's rages;/Thou thy worldly task hast done,/Home art gone and ta'en thy wages." A moving story of loss and recovery, Shakespeare's drama promises that a leap of faith can lead to miracles.</p><p><p>"He was not of an age, but for all time," declared Ben Jonson of his contemporary William Shakespeare (1564&#x2013;1616). Jonson's praise is especially prescient, since at the turn of the 17th century Shakespeare was but one of many popular London playwrights and none of his dramas were printed in his lifetime. The reason so many of his works survive is because two of his actor friends, with the assistance of Jonson, assembled and published the First Folio edition of 1623.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>Act 1 Scene 1 running scene 1<br><br>Enter two Gentlemen<br><br>FIRST GENTLEMAN??You do not meet a man but frowns.

In <em>The Gendered Society Reader</em>, Fifth Edition, coeditors Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson pull together an array of dynamic voices--both male and female, classic and contemporary--to examine various interpretations of gender. These lively, in-depth readings explore gender discourse over a wide range of disciplines, focusing primarily on two central issues: difference and domination. Carefully balanced to reflect the diversity of its subject, this text addresses provocative and fundamental questions including:<br><br>* How are males and females different?<br>* What do these differences mean?<br>* How do various cultures and religions interpret gender?<br>* Why do societies continue to differentiate people on the basis of gender?<br>* Why is it that almost every known society is based on male domination?<br><br>Michael Kimmel's textbook, <em>The Gendered Society</em>, Fifth Edition (OUP, 2013), provides a perfect complement for classroom use.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Kimmel</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Stony Brook University, State University of New York.

In writing this biography, however, C. Stuart Chapman gained valuable access through interviews and shared correspondence, an advantage Foote rarely has granted to others. </p><p> Born into Mississippi Delta gentry in 1916, Foote has engaged in a lifelong struggle with the realities behind his persona, the classic image of the southern gentleman. His polished civil graces mask a conflict deep within. Foote's beloved South is a changing region, and even progressive change, of which Foote approves, can be unsettling. In letters and interviews, and in his writings, he often waxes nostalgic as he grapples to recover the grace of an earlier time, particularly the era of the Civil War. Indeed, Chapman reveals that the whole of Foote's novels and historical narratives serves as a refuge from deeply ambiguous feelings. As Foote has struggled to understand the radical shifts brought to his native land by modernization and the region's integration into the nation, his personal history has been clouded by ideological conflict. </p><p> This biography shows him pining for aristocratic, antebellum culture while rejecting the practices that made possible the injustices of that era. Privately and vehemently, Foote opposed George C. Wallace's and Ross Barnett's untenable segregationist stance. Yet publicly during the 1960s and '70s he skirted the explosive race issue. </p><p> Foote is best known for his dazzling and definitive <i>The Civil War: A Narrative</i>. Written from 1954 to 1974, the three-volume opus was published during years when the South exploded with racial and political tensions and was forever changed.

Although <i>Love in a Dry Season</i>, <i>Jordan County</i>, and <i>September, September</i> are set in the contemporary South, they reach no firm social resolutions. Instead they entertain, dramatize, and come to grips with the social, gender, and racial barriers of the southern life he experienced. </p><p> While showing how Foote's guarded embrace of the South's past and present characterizes his identity as a thinker, a historian, and a writer of fiction, Chapman discloses Foote's reluctance to address burning contemporary issues and his veiled desire to recall more gracious times. </p><p>C.

Social Democrats and Communists today face each other as bitter political enemies across the front lines of the Cold War; yet they share a common origin in the Social Democratic Party of Imperial Germany. How did they come to go separate ways? By what process did the old party break apart? How did the prewar party prepare the ground for the dissolution of the labor movement in World War I, and for the subsequent extension of Leninism into Germany? To answer these questions is the purpose of Carl Schorske&#x2019;s study.</p><p>Carl E. Schorske was Professor of History, Princeton University.&#x201c;A masterful study! Professor Schorske&#x2019;s book combines the methodological thoroughness of a scholarly monograph with the breadth of political insight needed to investigate and explain Social Democratic history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Journal of Central European Affairs</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant and formidable analysis of the SDP in the period immediately following its formal rejection of revisionism... An extraordinary synthesis of intellectual, political and sociological history. [Schorske] succeeds in placing the story of the SDP in the general framework of German internal and foreign politics. He has a special flair for the lucid statement of difficult ideas, and combines this with a patience when dealing with endless materials concerning the institutional structures on both the national and the local level, of the party and the trade union movement alike.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>World Politics</i></b></p><h2>Chemical Demonstrations : A Handbook for Teachers of Chemistry Vol 2 (Volume 2)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrations capture interest, teach, inform, fascinate, amaze, and perhaps, most importantly, involve students in chemistry.

Joseph Wright (1855-1930) started work at the age of six as a donkey-boy in the local stone quarry. The next year he went to work in a woolen mill. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Wright tired of relying on his literate workmates for news and taught himself to read. Soon he was attending night school, and he later started his own night school, the money from which supported his study of Mathematics and German at the University of Heidelberg. After further studies at London, Heidelberg and Leipzig, he became a lecturer at Oxford, and eventually Professor of Comparative Philology.

The history of radionics is the story of how various inventors designed devices that employ directed intent to affect the real world. With these tools, they promoted healing without pills or surgery, grew crops without fertilizer, restrained insect predation without pesticides, and performed a host of other seemingly impossible feats that defy mechanistic science. THE SECRET ART traces this astonishing process beginning with early art designs suggestive of radionic intent. For many prehistoric and indigenous peoples, art was also a means of interacting with Nature to enhance healing, increase crop yields, and enable visionary experiences. Coincidentally, radionic inventors discovered by trial and error that even drawings and bizarre technology could function radionically. This discovery followed a long process of design innovation that started with mechanical devices, proceeded through a generation of electronic instruments, and most recently has been applied to computer and software technology. Conceivably, the theory and techniques outlined in this book could provide artists with a revolutionary approach to the creative process that is at once both new and timeless. A potential exists today for radionic ideas to empower creative individuals to develop skills in working with Nature that achieve profound real world results.</p><p></p><h2>Decisions Seeking God:s Guidance : 9 Studies for Individuals or Groups</h2><p>Do you sometimes wish that the Bible could make your decisions for you? Donald Baker is familiar with this desire. He writes, "God has given me free will, and while I appreciate his confidence in my ability to choose, there are times when I wish that he would make the decisions for me." The Bible won't give you a direct answer to each choice&#x2015;or dilemma&#x2015;you face. But the Bible will teach you how to make decisions wisely, confidently and in harmony with God's will. This nine-session LifeGuide� Bible Study will introduce you to the Bible's lessons on decisionmaking&#x2015;and show you how to apply what you learn to your own decisions, big and small. For over three decades LifeGuide Bible Studies have provided solid biblical content and raised thought-provoking questions&#x2015;making for a one-of-a-kind Bible study experience for individuals and groups.

The Durable Corporation rejects both of these notions to argue that sustainability is a more complex concept that involves balancing many factors. It explores the nature, value and role of sustainability in business and maintains that resource utilization must be based upon the twin pillars of equity and efficiency rather than attempting to ensure that our choices in the future are not reduced. The authors of The Durable Corporation propose a new model of sustainability and a fresh approach to managing resources. They extend this to the development of difference strategies for achieving sustainability and an alternative approach to managing for the future.

She created pioneering programs in the humanities and African American studies at Jackson State University, where she was a faculty member for almost three decades.From the opening lines of For My People (winner of the 1942 Yale Younger Poets award) to the last of a recently written group of poems titled "Farish Street," Walker writes with a strength and clarity that befits her large vision of American and African American history. She assumes the role of spokesperson and in the service of that role employs a multitude of techniques and inspirations: folklore, scriptural rhythms, ballad meter, sonnet forms, the Egyptian deities, political rhetoric.

Starting with the premise that Black women undergraduates are not a homogenous group and that they are being successful in college in greater numbers than Black men, this book examines the ways they navigate being traditionally underprepared academically for college, the discourse of �acting white�, and oppressive classroom settings and practices. This work expands the theoretical concept of cultural capital by identifying the abundant and varied forms of cultural capital that Black women undergraduates provide, develop, and utilize as they make their way through college. The discussion of their raced, classed, and gendered experiences challenges the academy to make use of this understanding in its work towards educational equity. This movement has wide-reaching implications for ethos, policy, and practice in higher education.</p><p>The Author: Cerri A.

Visit JohnGierachBooks.com.For devotees of fly fishing, this collection of 13 congenial essays takes readers to prime locations for the sport in the western U.S., including lesser-known streams and lakes. Gierach (Trout Bum) introduces certain innovations like the "fishing car," used only to transport anglers to their quarry, and with wit assesses the snobbery of "purist" fly-fishers. Along with relating his personal fishing successes, he explains differing practices in the sport occasioned by seasonal changesfor example, ice fishingand defines what constitutes a "big catch," be it trout or bass. Beyond Gierach's evocative descriptions of the angler's anticipation when on the water, the book is flavored by arch humor that suggests the author doesn't take fishing as seriously as he pretends. But he is clearly having a good time here, and readers are likely to share his enjoyment. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch)</h2><p><strong>Note: This book is a Large Print Edition.</strong><br><br>Winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C.

Gay&#39;s remarkable debut novel, The Long Home, is also the story of Amber Rose, a beautiful young woman forced to live beneath that evil who recognizes even as a child that Nathan is her first and last chance at escape. And it is the story of William Tell Oliver, a solitary old man who watches the growing evil from the dark woods and adds to his own weathered guilt by failing to do anything about it. Set in rural Tennessee in the 1940s, The Long Home will bring to mind once again the greatest Southern novelists and will haunt the reader with its sense of solitude , longing, and the deliverance that is always just out of reach.</p><p>In Willam Gay's debut novel, <i>The Long Home</i>, the devil comes to Tennessee in the form of one Dallas Hardin, a vile and violent man who brings tragedy in his wake. Set in the backwoods South of the 1940s, Gay's tale is populated with a colorful array of types familiar to readers of William Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, and other practitioners of that particular brand of larger-than-life literature that seems to thrive south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Though the types might be familiar, Gay does an impressive job of making them his own, each with his or her distinctive, fully human qualities that transcend the roles they play as bootlegger, town drunk, or even hero. <p> The story opens when Dallas Hardin ("Old Nick," according to one character--"or whatever he's goin' by now") comes to town and wrests away home, wife, and whiskey still from the seriously ill Thomas Hovington. Only in a Southern novel could such an event be preceded by the inexplicable opening of a brimstone-scented pit near the victim's house without the reader even blinking an eye. Enter young Nathan Winer, hired by Hardin to build a honky-tonk. Winer starts out thinking he can earn his wage while steering clear of his employer's evil ways, but it soon becomes apparent that he can't--especially after he falls in love with Tom Hovington's daughter, now Hardin's stepdaughter, Amber Rose. Having given his heart, Nathan has taken the first inexorable step towards a final, deadly confrontation with the devil. </p><p> If Gay's themes are big--nothing less than the battle between good and evil--and his metaphors drawn unabashedly from that old-time religion, his novel is nonetheless firmly grounded in the flesh-and-bone world--sometimes nightmarishly so. There is a <i>lot</i> of blood spilt over the course of this novel, in myriad ways and in graphic detail. Indeed, one quality that <i>The Long Home</i> shares with most of Cormac McCarthy's work is that it is definitely not for the faint-hearted. But Gay balances the horror with moments of true beauty, and his novel is undeniably compelling. Enjoy it for its many strengths and for its promise of a bright literary future <i>--Sheila Bright</i></p>William Gay lives in Hohenwald, Tennessee.

But it's not easy being different--a cockroach with a cricked wing and a flair for sculpture is a ready target for the bigger creatures in the forest. Crickwing just wants to even the score, and leafcutter ants are so easy to pick on. . . .Big mistake. Nobody angers the leafcutter queen and gets away with it.<br> In this epic adventure beneath the foliage, Crickwing and the leafcutter ants go head-to-head. Then a swarm of ferocious army ants threatens, and suddenly everyone is in danger. Crickwing has to do something, but what? He's an artist, not a fighter. What the leafcutters need is a hero. Or, maybe, a cockroach with a really clever idea. . . .<br></p><p>Janell Cannon, best-known for her award-winning picture books <i>Stellaluna</i> and <i>Verdi</i>, departs from the world of bats and snakes and turns her attention to... cockroaches. None of these are particularly cuddly creatures, but seen through Cannon's anthropomorphizing glasses, they are ones we can sympathize with. Crickwing, cruelly named for his twisted wing, is a lonely food stylist. He builds sculptures out of roots, leaves, and petals... and then eats them. But artistic serenity is not possible in the dangerous forest. The melancholy insect is constantly faced with cockroach-eating lizards, ocelots, and worse, food-stealing monkeys: "'Another masterpiece--ruined!' Crickwing panted. 'I'm starving and my wing aches. I don't know if I can take this much longer.'" <p> Bemoaning his fate as a "mere exoskeleton," Crickwing wakes up with thoughts of vengeance. As he watches thousands of leaf-cutting ants busy at work, he wonders, "Why isn't anyone bothering <i>these</i> little twerps?" He sticks his spiny leg out to trip one of them, and delights in taunting them further. Of course, the ants don't take this well. They swarm him, drag him into the dark corridors of their anthill, and bury him up to his neck--all the while whispering about how his mother must be heartbroken to have produced such an awful menace. Just as they are about to fork him over as their annual peace offering to the army ants, they have a crisis of conscience. "Nobody deserves that, not even this big bully," says one of the ants, and, risking the wrath of their queen, they release him and flee. Now it's Crickwing's turn to have a conscience. He races after the leafcutters with his creative plan to keep the warring army ants at bay. The story ends in a festive explosion of flower confetti, and a valuable lesson in compassion. The concluding "Cockroach Notes" and "Ant Notes" crawl with fascinating facts about our six-legged friends.

The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. <p> A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Visit the <i>Harry Potter</i> Store</strong> <br> Our <i>Harry Potter</i> Store features all things Harry, including books (box sets and collector's editions), audio CDs and cassettes, DVDs, soundtracks, games, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Begin at the Beginning</strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i><br> <br>Hardcover <br> Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> <td><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i><br><br>Hardcover<br>Paperback </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <strong>Why We Love Harry</strong> <br> <i>Favorite Moments from the Series</i><br>There are plenty of reasons to love Rowling's wildly popular series--no doubt you have several dozen of your own.

More than 200 exhaustively tested recipes and hand-drawn illustrations, kitchen equipment tests and blind food tastings that share our discoveries of the undisputed best ways to make America&#39;s favorite soups and stews. 3rd title in &#34;The Best Recipe&#34; series.</p><p>Everyone loves soups and stews--but how best to prepare these sometimes challenging dishes? <i>The Best Recipe: Soups &amp; Stews</i>, part of the Best Recipe series from the editors of <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> magazine, has the answer. Applying its signature "trial and error" approach to the business of choosing definitive recipes and techniques, the magazine tested 23 noodle soups, 40 corn chowders, and 54 beef Burgundies. The results? Not only 200 exemplary recipes--ranging from Manhattan Clam Chowder and Cream of Tomato Soup to Lobster Bisques, Chicken Noodle Soup, Irish Stew, and Beef Goulash--but an armament of technical information, tips, and equipment recommendations all cooks will welcome. Among these are authoritative stock-making suggestions, keys to choosing tender stew meat, and recommendations that yield a superior crust for onion soup. Readers also learn why blender jars with interior flutes produce the best pur�es, which brand of matzo meal to choose, and how best to crush tomatoes and slice flank steak. The book also covers accompaniments such as baguettes, mashed potatoes, rice, and cornbread. With ingredient profiles, "Science" sidebars (How Starches Work, is one), plus step-by-step how-to illustrations, <i>Soups &amp; Stews</i> will help all cooks achieve mastery of these beloved dishes <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>The newest addition to the Cook's Illustrated (How to Grill, How to Make a Pizza, etc.) library dives into the world of soups and stews, from the most basic chicken stock to a silky lobster bisque. This weighty volume is divided into four helpful sections: the first covers equipment and ingredients (including recipes for the necessary homemade stocks); the middle two focus on soups and stews; and the final one addresses the matter of accompaniments. Inserts provide descriptions of ingredients, details of their preparation, and the impact they have on dishes. An introduction to each recipe describes the testing processes involved in determining its final proportions and directions, so that chefs are treated to the "why" as well as the "how." Soups range from the classic Chicken Noodle Soup and the warming Mushroom-Barley Soup to the spicy, creamy Indian Dal Soup, a variation on the Lentil Soup. Chilled soups include favorites like Borscht and Vichyssoise, as well as more unusual fruit soups, such as Chilled Melon Soup sweetened with honey. For stews, there's everything from the Hearty Beef Stew to the robust, sweet and piquant Country Captain Chicken, which was one of FDR's personal favorites. The vegetarian is not forgotten, either: there are vegetable stews and suggestions for animal-friendly substitutions in several of the recipes. Accompaniments, like the subtle Basmati Rice, Pilaf Style or the fluffy Mashed Potatoes, perfectly complement this impressive compendium of liquid cuisine. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Defiant: The POWs Who Endured Vietnam&#39;s Most Infamous Prison</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;<i>Unbroken </i>meets <i>Band of Brothers&#x2015;</i>and then some.&#x201d;</b><br><b> &#x2015;Congressman Pete Sessions</b></p><p>During the Vietnam War, hundreds of American prisoners-of-war faced years of brutal conditions and horrific torture at the hands of North Vietnamese guards and interrogators who ruthlessly plied them for military intelligence and propaganda.

What these men endured nearly defies description, but Alvin Townley has managed to pull it off brilliantly. The writing is hard-hitting and powerful, dynamic and breath-taking. So, too, is his retelling of the stoic courage of the loved ones stuck at home with uncertainty and doubt: uncertainty about their own abilities to bear up, then doubt in the fortitude and truthfulness of their own government. What the families did from afar, and how they ultimately put backbone into their own leaders and pushed accountability onto the captors of the POWs, is a story heretofore largely untold.

By describing the POWs' scenes of torture and deprivation in such detail--to the point we can almost feel our own bones crack under pressure--he reminds us that we should never take our civil liberties for granted.

Rizzoli: Architect of Magnificent Visions</h2><p>He has been compared to Blake, Piranesi, and Escher, and his imaginative architectural drawings have been described as "the find of the century." Outwardly, he was a recluse who had few companions except for his mother and children in the neighborhood; inwardly, he was the creator of fantastic renderings, including an attempt late in life to transcribe a third testament of the Bible. He is A. G. Rizzoli (1896-1981), visionary artist extraordinaire.<br>The discovery of Rizzoli's Beaux Arts-style drawings in San Francisco came in 1990, when they were brought to the attention of a keen-eyed dealer. Since that time, Rizzoli has acquired a fame that would astonish this shy, conflicted man. Essays about Rizzoli's life, analyses of his work and writings, and sources of his inspiration are presented in this first-ever survey by scholars John Beardsley, Roger Cardinal, and Jo Farb Hernandez.<br>A. G. Rizzoli: Architect of Magnificent Visions brings together for the first time a dazzling array of works. In addition the book includes a chronology, glossary of terms (for the artist was an acrobatic linguist), and list of pseudonyms and self-referential titles. Today Rizzoli is regarded as one of the most astonishing visionary or outsider artists, with an avid following from California to New York. This book will accompany a major traveling exhibition in the U.S., organized by the San Diego Museum of Art.</p><p>Published to accompany a two-year traveling exhibition of A. G. Rizzoli's work, <i>Architect of Magnificent Visions</i> is the exhibition's catalog as well as the definitive study of the life and work of this visionary artist and architect. Working by day as a humble draftsman in a small San Francisco architecture firm, the reclusive Rizzoli created his extraordinary color-ink renderings of his dream city and other visions in secret during his spare time. His meticulous, highly detailed drawings of Gothic cathedrals, skyscrapers, and domes were intended as symbolic architectural stand-ins for people he knew, particularly his mother, whom he worshipfully depicted as an elaborate fortress. Hailed by curators as "the find of the century," Rizzoli's drawings were unearthed 10 years after his death. The 94 illustrations reproduced in this beautiful volume, including 36 in full color, as well as the insightful essays by experts in the study of "outsider" art (artwork typically produced by someone untrained in the arts and that is not associated with any particular artistic or cultural movement), interpret Rizzoli's bizarre life and work in ways accessible to both scholars and the general public.</p><h2>Coffee</h2><p>For many of us, coffee is one of the essential pleasures of life.

From the armed Saxon bands that descended onto Roman-controlled Britain in the fifth century to the travails of the Eurozone plaguing the prime-ministership of today's multicultural England, acclaimed historian Robert Tombs presents a momentous and challenging history of a people who have a claim to be the oldest nation in existence.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on a wealth of recent scholarship, Tombs sheds light on the strength and resilience of English governance, the deep patterns of division among the people who have populated the British Isles, the persistent capacity of the English to come together in the face of danger, and not the least the ways the English have understood their own history, have argued about it, forgotten it and yet been shaped by it.

That paradox is the incredibility gap that has made most Americans reject the evidence about 9/11 as paranoid fantasy. </p><p> Tarpley brings decades of expertise to the 9/11 issue. In 1978 he exposed the terrorist Red Brigades as patsies of Italy's fascist P2 shadow government, and 9/11 is on the same pattern. The forthright subtitle, Made in USA, is backed up by an analysis of key figures who behave like moles working for the insidious network. </p><p> 9/11 Synthetic Terror highlights the salient points of sheer physical impossibility of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory. It makes clear that figures like Osama bin Laden are patsies, dupes or double agents, selected for their ethnic coloring as the basis for launching a "Clash of Civilizations," and how absurd it is to imagine that such tools of US intelligence agencies could turn around and infiltrate or overwhelm US defenses unaided. </p><p> Tarpley shows that the wars on the Islamic world, the Soviet-Afghan, Kosovo and Chechen conflicts, as well as US-UK-NATO synthetic terror incidents like 9/11, Beslan or 3/11 in Madrid, have been contrived to continue the Cold War, in pursuit of the centuries-long campaign for Anglo hegemony over Eurasia and the world. </p><p> The preface to the second edition explains the significance and superiority of "MIHOP" vs "LIHOP," and the many drills on 9/11 and on 7/7, which were cover and conduit for those false-flag operations. </p><p> The third edition preface makes clear that 9/11 is the only issue that can stop a new world war and the descent into a police state. It shows up the cowardice of the "left gatekeepers" on this score. The analysis of Moussaoui on trial as a classic weak-minded patsy -- part double agent, part fanatic -- again shows the unique power of Tarpley's mole-patsy model to debunk the lies put out by the war party. </p><p> For a principled refutation of the 9/11 propaganda myth in all its parts, Tarpley's bombshell, brilliant book - I strongly recommend 911 Synthetic Terror. Should be required reading for all honest truth seekers, s work is indispensable.</p></p><p>For a principled refutation of the 9/11 propaganda myth in all its parts, Tarpley's work is indispensable. This new, fifth edition adds a significant new dimension. Tarpley's documentation of a comprehensive array of 9/11 drills may prove as revolutionary as the thesis of controlled demolition - perhaps even more so. Many people have been unable to see that 9/11 was a false flag. They may seem immune to physical facts like the free-fall speed of the towers, as they take refuge in a lack of engineering qualifications. No math skills are needed to grasp the more familiar, common-sense fact that an act that is rehearsed is also staged. Moreover, when we learn how drills are essential to conduit such operations, we can recognize many types of false flags, such as the London bombings, and not only building collapses. Finally, wider public awareness of the dangerous workings of drills could help prevent terror operations, by making them too difficult to carry out with impunity.<p> The authoritative work on 9/11 and state-sponsored false-flag terrorism. 9/11 Synthetic Terror is the only book to present a working model for the event - a network of moles, patsies, paramilitary pros, privatized intelligence assets and corrupt media corporations. We see how this enormous provocation was successfully executed and exploited as war propaganda. This new, fifth edition reveals a whole new dimension of explosive facts for the first time: the enormous array of drills in which the US defense apparatus rehearsed every aspect of the 9/11 operation. Author Webster Tarpley presents the corpus of 9/11 research - such as the controlled demolition of the three WTC towers - from the perspective of a veteran intelligence expert and historian. The exploit is placed in the geopolitical context of oligarchy and imperialism - in the tradition of precedents such as the Gunpowder Plot, the USS Maine, the Strategy of Tension, and other historically decisive state-sponsored terror subterfuges.</p>The humanist contemporary political philosopher Webster Griffin Tarpley is our most incisive critic of Anglo-American hegemony. As an activist historian he is best known for his George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography (1992), a masterpiece of research which is still must reading. He is a 9/11 Truth Scholar and activist; AB Princeton 1966, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa; Fulbright Scholar at University of Turin, Italy; and MA in humanities from Skidmore College. <p> He is fluent in Italian, German, French, Latin and Russian. A decades-long expert on international terrorism, his 1978 study for the Italian parliament "Chi ha ucciso Aldo Moro?" (Who Killed Aldo Moro?) broke open the ownership of the "Red Brigades" by NATO's clandestine "stay-behind" networks.</p></p><h2>Good Dog, Carl (Star &amp; elephant book)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

The book begins with the mother saying, "Look after the baby, Carl. I'll be back shortly." Let the adventure begin! Carl looks out the window to make sure Mom is gone. Once the coast is clear, the baby crawls out of the crib and onto Carl's back. First stop? Mom's bed. Second stop? The top of the dresser where powder puffs are sported as hats. The infant--now in Carl's capable paws--slides down the laundry chute, swims in the fish tank, dances, raids the refrigerator, and makes a huge mess. Carl dutifully bathes the baby, cleans up the chaos, puts his charge back in the crib, and plays it cool when Mom comes home. "Good dog, Carl!" she says upon her return.

Of course, technically, the artisan baker down the road is much better at it, but no amount of skill and craftsmanship can replace the utter joy of eating and sharing the stuff you make yourself. And it is practical to make bread -- exceptional bread -- with your own hands, in your own home, on a regular basis. <br>&nbsp;<br>I know you are busy, so I have given you roti -- a flat bread you can make, from cupboard to table, in less than five minutes. But I know that you also have free time, and I hope I can persuade you that free time spent in the kitchen -- by yourself, with friends, or with children, with music in your ears, wine in your glass, flour in your hair, and magic in your hands -- is time that could not be better spent. <br>&nbsp;<br>If you are new to bread making, this sense of pleasure might not be immediate, but I am confident that you will reach it more quickly than I did. I remember my first loaf well -- even the birds wouldn&#x2019;t eat it. I had followed the two-page recipe to the letter and the cookbook assured me that &#x201c;homemade bread is easy.&#x201d; That was rather hard to swallow (as was my bread). Still, I soldiered on, day after day. After all, practice makes perfect. <br>&nbsp;<br>There are two kinds of bread in the world: bread that hands have made, and bread that hands have not. In an ideal world, all bread would be hands-have-made -- by your hands and my hands, and by the hands of those few professional bakers left who are still doing it properly. I guess there will always be hands-have-not bread, and while it&#x2019;s not that bad, or at least it is surely edible, it seems a shame that bread has become so standard and commonplace that we don&#x2019;t even consider what a small miracle a risen loaf is. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mass-produced bread<br>&nbsp;<br>Some would say that 1961 was a bad year for bread. It was the year the Chorleywood Bread Process came into being. Developed by the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association in Chorleywood, England, the process revolutionized the baking industry. This high-speed mechanical mixing process allowed the fermentation time to be drastically reduced and meant that lower-protein British wheats could be used in place of the more expensive North American imports. Various chemical improvers and antifungal agents are necessary ingredients, as are certain hydrogenated or fractionated hard fats. This is high-output, low-labor production, designed to maximize efficiency and profit at the expense of the consumer. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mass-produced bread is almost undoubtedly worse for you. Apart from the dubious additives and fats it contains, the short fermentation makes the wheat harder to digest. Indeed, some believe the Chorleywood processing method is partly to blame for a sharp increase in gluten intolerance and allergy. It is also probable that the prolific crossbreeding and modification of modern-day wheat, to produce stronger, tougher, harder-to-digest gluten, has contributed to wheat intolerance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Somewhere in the region of 98 percent of bread baked in England is mass-produced, and most of it comes from around a dozen huge plant bakeries. Supermarkets love to crow about their in-store bakeries, but they are really nothing more than mini versions of these plants. And 98 percent is a lot. That means hands-have-not bread is not just the preserve of the supermarkets; it is the same bread you buy in most local &#x201c;bakeries.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m talking about the ones that sell white pan loaves with flat tops and apple turnovers, where there is little hint of baking activity save for the oven warming of sausage rolls, ham-and-cheese croissants, and &#x201c;Cornish&#x201d; pasties. The bakeries whose bread looks the same as everyone else&#x2019;s . . . Well, nearly everyone else&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bread from real bakeries<br>&nbsp;<br>Real bakeries are special places where bread is made in small batches by real people&#x2019;s hands and baked on-site. You can tell when bread is made by hand. For a start, it will look different from other bread in other shops, because every baker has a unique, recognizable style. Shop at one regularly and you may spot changes in the bread from one morning to the next. You may even be able to tell if the baker was in a bad mood, so sensitive is real bread to the hands that make it. Some real bakeries sell their bread to local stores, which is excellent -- the more places selling real bread, the better. Real bakeries are a rarity, though. If you are lucky enough to have one near you, then you would be mad not to use it. The bread will cost more . . . So it should. <br>&nbsp;<br>Bread made at home<br>&nbsp;<br>Home is the bakery where handmade bread does not cost more. At home, you can produce a large loaf, made with organic flour, for less than half the price of a similar-sized, mass-produced, non-organic loaf from a local shop. And your homemade bread can be great bread -- even if it doesn&#x2019;t quite go according to plan the first time.<br>&nbsp;<br>I still have that first bread recipe I attempted -- both pages of it. And now, years later, I realize why my first loaf was such a disaster. The basic method is fine, but to make good bread you need to understand the process. Some professional bakers and cookery writers skirt this all too briefly. As I discovered, being told what to do is simply not enough. There is so much to know, and I really believe that the more you know, the better your bread will be. Two pages? Not even the best baker in the world could teach bread in two pages. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The basic bread recipe<br>&nbsp;<br>This is my simplified bread recipe, which can be adapted to create a host of different breads (see chart on p. 75). You will find more detail on the essential stages (highlighted in bold below) in the previous chapter. To begin, you need to<b> </b>measure the ingredients.<br>&nbsp;<br>Makes 2 large or 3 small loaves, or 12 rolls<br>&nbsp;<br>Essential<br>8 cups (2 pounds, 3 ounces/1kg) flour<br>1 tablespoon (0.35 ounce/10g) instant yeast <br>4 teaspoons (0.7 ounce/20g) fine salt<br>21/2 cups liquid (warm)<br>&nbsp;<br>Optional<br>2 handfuls of extras<br>A piece of old dough, or a ladleful <br>of sourdough starter<br>About 1 tablespoon (a good slug) of fat<br>2 handfuls of coating<br>Scant 1 cup milk or water (if coating <br>with anything other than flour)<br>&nbsp;<br>First, mix the dough. This is the one-stage method; you can adapt it for other methods. Combine the <i>flour</i>, yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add smaller <i>extras</i> if you are using them (save nuts and dried fruit for after kneading). Add the <i>liquid</i> and, with one hand, mix to a rough dough. Add a piece of old dough or the starter if you are using one. Add the <i>fat</i> if you are including it and mix it all together. Adjust the consistency if you need to, with a little more flour or water (or your chosen liquid), to make a soft, easily kneadable, sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and clean your hands. <br>&nbsp;<br>Knead the dough until it is as smooth and satiny as you can make it -- as a rough guide, this will take about 10 minutes. If you are using larger <i>extras</i>, like nuts and fruit, stretch the dough out on the work surface, scatter the ingredients over the dough, then fold, roll, and knead briefly, to disperse them. <br>&nbsp;<br>Shape the dough into a round<b> </b>once you have finished kneading. Then oil or flour the surface and put the dough into the wiped-out mixing bowl. Put the bowl in a trash bag and let ferment and rise until doubled in size. This could be anywhere between 45 minutes and 11/2 hours -- or longer still, if the dough is cold.<br>&nbsp;<br>Deflate the dough by tipping it onto the work surface and pressing all over with your fingertips. Then form it into a round. If you like, let rise again up to four times. This will improve the texture and flavor. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now,<b> </b>prepare for baking.<b> </b>Turn on the oven to 500�F or its highest setting, put your baking stone or baking sheet in position, and remove any unwanted racks. Put the roasting pan in the bottom if you are using it for steam (in which case, put the kettle on). Get your water spray bottle ready if you have one, your serrated knife if using, a hot pad, and your peel if you are using a baking stone. Clear the area around the oven. <br>&nbsp;<br>Divide the dough into as many pieces as you wish (I suggest 2 large or 3 small loaves, or a dozen rolls). Shape these into rounds and let them rest, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. <br>&nbsp;<br>Shape the loaves as you wish, and coat the outside<b> </b>with your chosen <i>coating</i>. Transfer the loaves to well-floured wooden boards, linen cloths, tea towels, or proofing baskets and lay a plastic bag over the whole batch, to keep it from drying out. Let proof, checking often by giving gentle squeezes, until the loaves have almost doubled in size. <br>&nbsp;<br>Transfer the loaves for baking to the hot baking sheet (removed from the oven), or one at a time to the peel. Slash the tops, if you wish, with the serrated knife, and before you bake the bread,<b> </b>spray it all over with water if you can. If using steam, bring the boiling teakettle to the oven. Put the pan in the oven, or slide each loaf onto the stone, pour some boiling water into the roasting pan, if using, and close the door as quickly as you can. <br>&nbsp;<br>After about 10 minutes, turn down the heat to 400�F if the crust still looks very pale; 350�F if the crust is noticeably browning; or 325�F if the crust seems to be browning quickly. Bake until the loaves are well browned and crusty and feel hollow when you tap them: in total, 10 to 20 minutes for rolls; 30 to 40 minutes for small loaves; or 40 to 50 minutes for large loaves. If in doubt, bake for a few minutes longer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let cool on a wire rack, or anything similar that allows air underneath. Bread for tearing can be served warm, but bread for slicing must be cooled completely.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Look after your bread and enjoy it. After all, you have put a lot of work into it. And don&#x2019;t waste a crumb.<br>&nbsp;<br>P.S. Remember that timing in the recipe relates to convection ovens. If using a conventional electric or gas oven, increase the temperature by 25�F. Use an oven thermometer to check the accuracy of your oven.</p><h2>Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain</h2><p>A guide which identifies and illustrates more than 500 species of British wild flowers.

Very Good, A very good, near fine copy in black cloth boards, gilt title on spine with a very good dust jacket. DJ has slight curl to upper edge but otherwise fine. Leo Marks. 613 p., 8 pages of plates, ill., ports.</p><p>At the age of 8, Leo Marks discovered the great game of code-making and -breaking in his father's London bookshop, thanks to a first edition of Poe's <i>The Gold-Bug</i>. At 23, as World War II was being played out in earnest, he hoped to use his strengths for the Allies. But Marks's urgent, witty memoir, <i>Between Silk and Cyanide</i>, begins with his failure to get into British Intelligence's cryptographic department. As everyone else on his course heads off to Bletchley Park ("the promised land"), he is sent to what his sergeant terms "some potty outfit in Baker Street, an open house for misfits." In fact, the Special Operations Executive's mandate was, in Churchill's stirring phrase, to "Set Europe Ablaze," and Marks's was to monitor code security so that agents could could report back as safely as possible. When he arrived, the common wisdom was that it was easiest for men and women in the field to memorize and use well-known poems.<p> Unfortunately, since the Germans had equal access to the classics--"Reference books," Marks quips, "are jackboots when used by cryptographers"--Marks thought agents should write their own poems (or use his) instead, several of which are cheerily obscene. After all, no son or daughter of the Fatherland could ever know the rest of a verse that began "Is de Gaulle's prick / Twelve inches thick," and continued on in a similar, shall we say, vein. But Marks soon felt that original doggerel was just as dangerous, since even slight misspellings could render messages indecipherable and risk agents' lives. His first solution? WOKs (worked-out keys) printed on silk. An operative would use one key, send the message, and immediately tear off the strip. Marks had a hard time proving that swaths of silk would save his people from swallowing their "optional extra," a cyanide pill. His efforts were dead serious, but often landed him in comic terrain.</p><p> In one of the book's great set pieces, Marks visits Colonel Wills--surely the model for Ian Fleming's Q--in order to sort out the best ways to print his code keys. Before solving this minor problem (invisible ink!), Wills showed Marks several new projects--one of which involves an exotic array of dung, courtesy of the London Zoo. This gifted gadgetmeister planned to model life-sized reproductions of these droppings and pack them with explosives, personalized for all parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. "Once trodden on or driven over (hopefully by the enemy) the whole lot would go off with a series of explosions even more violent than the ones which had produced it," Marks explains. </p><p> Despite such larky sentences and sections, the author never loses sight of the importance of his vocation, and <i>Between Silk and Cyanide</i> is as elegiac as it is engaging. Marks knows when to cut the laugh track, particularly as his book becomes a despairing record of agents blown--lost to torture, prison, the camps, and execution. Readers will never forget the valor of Violette Szabo, Noor Inayat Kahn, and the White Rabbit himself, Flight Lieutenant Yeo-Thomas. Poem-cracking, as Marks again and again makes clear, was far more than a parlor game. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>In 1942, Leo Marks left his father's famous London bookshop, 84 Charing Cross Road, and went off to fight the war. He was twenty-two. Soon recognized as a cryptographer of genius, he became head of communications at the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where he revolutionized the codemaking techniques of the Allies and trained some of the most famous agents dropped into occupied Europe, including "the White Rabbit" and Violette Szabo. As a top codemaker, Marks had a unique perspective on one of the most fascinating and, until now, little-known aspects of the Second World War.<p>Writing with the narrative flair and vivid characterization of his famous screenplays, Marks gives free rein to his keen sense of the absurd and his wry wit, resulting in a thrilling and poignant memoir that celebrates individual courage and endeavor, without losing sight of the human cost and horror of war.</p></p><h2>Murder Flies the Coop (A Beryl and Edwina Mystery)</h2><p><i>One would hardly call them birds of a feather, but thrill-seeking American adventuress Beryl Helliwell and quietly reserved Brit Edwina Davenport do one thing very well together&#x2014;solve murders . . .</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Sharing lodging in the sleepy English village of Walmsley Parva has eased some of the financial strain on the two old school chums, but money is still tight in these lean years following the Great War.

Over the next twenty-six years, the United States backed the unpopular, authoritarian shah and his secret police; in exchange, it reaped a share of Iran&#x2019;s oil wealth and became a key player in this volatile region.<br> <br>The blowback was almost inevitable, as this new and revealing history of the coup and its consequences shows. When the 1979 Iranian Revolution deposed the shah and replaced his puppet government with a radical Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the shift reverberated throughout the Middle East and the world, casting a long, dark shadow over U.S.-Iran relations that extends to the present day.<br> <br>In this authoritative new history of the coup and its aftermath, noted Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian uncovers little-known documents that challenge conventional interpretations and also sheds new light on how the American role in the coup influenced U.S.-Iranian relations, both past and present. Drawing from the hitherto closed archives of British Petroleum, the Foreign Office, and the U.S. State Department, as well as from Iranian memoirs and published interviews, Abrahamian&#x2019;s riveting account of this key historical event will change America&#x2019;s understanding of a crucial turning point in modern U.S.-Iranian relations.</p><p><b>Ervand Abrahamian</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Tortured Confessions</i>, <i>Khomeinism</i>, <i>Iran Between Two Revolutions</i>, and <i>A History of Modern Iran</i>.

In this slim, readable volume, Iran scholar Abrahamian (A History of Modern Iran) delves into the genesis and aftermath of that operation, challenging the idea that Mossadeq's intransigence made the putsch inevitable. Making extensive use of recently declassified diplomatic cables and the archives of multinational oil companies especially the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP the author makes the case that the U.K. and the U.S., unwilling to back down over the hard issue of nationalization [of the oil industry]... were the main stumbling blocks&#x2019; in the relationship between Iran and the West. . . . his primer skillfully weaves together primary sources to tell an engaging tale of the machinations, intrigues, and personalities at the heart of the crisis.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br> <br>"Abrahamian has done for Iran what de Tocqueville did for France."<br> Edward Mortimer, author of <i>Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam</i>, on Ervand Abrahamian&#x2019;s <i>A History of Modern Iran</i> <br> <br>"A relevant, readable study of the foreign-engineered 1953 Iranian coup reminds us of the cause that won&#x2019;t go away: oil."<br> <i>Kirkus</i> <br> <br>"In this thorough, well researched work, Abrahamian (Iranian &amp; Middle Eastern history &amp; politics, CUNY) breaks down the generally accepted understanding of the details behind the 1953 CIA run coup that ousted Iran&#x2019;s prime minister, Muhammad Mossadeq, and supported the shah. The author reveals some of the primary motivations behind the current Iranian hostility toward the United States and other Western governments. Through his well documented research, Abrahamian paints a picture of the coup in the context of British and U.S. oil interests, contrasting these motivations with the desire to curb the spread of Soviet influences. In his examination of information recently made available from the British Foreign Office, the U.S. Department of State, the Anglo Iranian Oil Company (now BP), and other government documents, Abrahamian pieces together the intricacies of the relationships among these parties and provides a sound argument for the control of oil resources as the dominating issue behind the coup. <b>VERDICT This latest research from Abrahamian is a must read for anyone wanting a clearer understanding of the history behind current U.S. Iranian relations. Recommended for Middle East history enthusiasts and specialists, as well as those seeking a full understanding of current international affairs.</b>"<br> <i>Library Journal</i> <br></p><h2>The Notebook</h2><p>Thought-provoking and lyrical, <i>The Notebook</i> records the last year in the life of Jos� Saramago. In these pages, beginning on the eve of the 2008 US presidential election, he evokes life in his beloved city of Lisbon, revisits conversations with friends, and meditates on his favorite authors. Precise observations and moments of arresting significance are rendered with pointillist detail and together demonstrate an acute understanding of our times. Characteristically critical and uncompromising, Saramago dissects the financial crisis, deplores Israel&#x2019;s punishment of Gaza, and reflects on the rise of Barack Obama. <i>The Notebook</i> is a unique journey into the personal and political world of one of the greatest writers of our time.</p><p>The Portuguese Nobel Laureate <b>Jose?

Jensen.</i><br><br>C�cile and Tristan have accomplished the impossible, but their greatest challenge remains: defeating the evil they have unleashed upon the world.<br><br>As they scramble for a way to protect the people of the Isle and liberate the trolls from their tyrant king, C�cile and Tristan must battle those who'd see them dead. To win, they will risk everything. And everyone.<br><br>But it might not be enough. Both C�cile and Tristan have debts, and they will be forced to pay them at a cost far greater than they had ever imagined.</p><p>Danielle L Jensen was born and raised in Calgary, Canada. At the insistence of the left side of her brain, she graduated in 2003 from the University of Calgary with a bachelor's degree in finance. But the right side of her brain has ever been mutinous; and in 2010, it sent her back to school to complete an entirely impractical English literature degree at Mount Royal University and to pursue publication. Much to her satisfaction, the right side shows no sign of relinquishing its domination. Her debut <b>Stolen Songbird</b> was a USA Today Bestseller.Praise and Reviews for the&nbsp;<i>Warrior Witch</i>:<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Warrior Witch</i>&nbsp;IS the ending that this amazing series deserves.

Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, between 1865 and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1890. Historian David Herbert Donald has called Herndon's materials "the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; basic source for Abraham Lincoln's early years."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of those Herndon questioned<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were illiterate; others could read but barely write. Completion of this<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undertaking took the editors to three major collections for the mammoth<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;task of transcribing documents that often were nearly illegible.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invaluable to Lincoln scholars<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and intriguing to anyone curious about Lincoln and his times, the book<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; includes an introduction, scholarly annotations, a registry of the informants,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a detailed topical index.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Publication of this long-awaited volume makes available for the first time in complete and accessible form the most important source of information on Lincoln&#39;s early life. For twenty-five years after the president&#39;s death William Herndon, his law partner, conducted interviews with and solicited letters from dozens of persons who knew Lincoln personally. Up to now, the valuable information he collected has been available only in a microfilm edition in the Library of Congress, of such poor quality that it has been rarely used, particularly since there was no table of contents or adequate index, and in collections at the Huntington Library and the Illinois State Historical Library. The only previous publication of Herndon&#39;s materials, more than a half century ago, contains less than 10 percent of the collection and is so unreliable that scholars have hesitated to use it. Douglas Wilson and Rodney Davis have earned the gratitude and admiration of scholars by taking on the daunting task of collating the collections in the three libraries, painstakingly deciphering the all but illegible handwriting of Herndon and some of his informants, and carefully documenting the entire work.<b>Douglas L.

George Maciunas (1931-1978) established strangely radical modes of presentation in the name of Fluxus.

Art was to be so uncomplicated that it could be realized by anyone, anywhere. New pieces would have their copyrights protected and would be available for the price of a paperback. Maciunas was a staunch opponent of personal enrichment and came up with spartan solutions for almost every life situation. Despite his tireless efforts, he never achieved his ultimate goal, and he died impoverished and in miserable circumstances. 100 duotone illustrations.</p><p><b>Thomas Kellein</b>, Director of the Kunsthalle Bielefeld since 1996, was formerly curator of the extensive Hanns Sohm Intermedia Archive in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart.</p><h2>Capitalism &amp; Slavery</h2><p>An economic study of the role of slavery in providing the capital for the industial revolution and the role of mature industrial capitalism in destroying the slave system.</p><p>Eric Williams's Capitalism &amp; Slavery became the foundation for many future studies of imperialism and economic development.

When five-year-old Clara Bynum drowns in the Potomac River under a seemingly haunted rock outcropping known locally as the Three Sisters, the community must reconcile themselves to the bitter tragedy.<i><br></i>Clarke powerful charts the fallout from Clara's death on the people she has left behind: her parents, Alice and Willie Bynum, torn between the old world of their rural North Carolina home and the new world of the city; the friends and relatives of the Bynum family in the Georgetown neighborhood they now call home; and, most especially, Clara's sister, ten-year-old Johnnie Mae, who is thrust into adolescence and must come to terms with the terrible and confused emotions stirred by her sister's death. <br>This highly accomplished first novel reverberates with ideas, impassioned lyricism, and poignant historical detail as it captures an essential and moving portrait of the Washington, DC community.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, October 1999:</b> Breena Clarke's first novel takes place in Georgetown in 1925, where a large and close-knit African American community took shape beneath the shadow of segregation. At the center of the story is baby Clara, who is swallowed by the Potomac as her sister, Johnnie Mae, cools off in the brackish water. It's the only place the girls can find relief--they're banned from the new, clean swimming pool the white kids use.<p> After Clara drowns, the river is never the same, and Johnnie Mae hovers on the edge of womanhood wondering if she'll be able to get past her guilt and emptiness. In an eloquent passage, Clarke writes, "Losing a loved one, a family member, is like losing a tooth. After a while, those teeth remaining shift and lean and spread out to split the distance between themselves and the other teeth still left, trying to close up spaces."</p><p> Bits of wisdom like this are the book's charm. Most remarkable are the church scenes, which Clarke renders almost purely in the give-and-take of voices: the booming preacher's sermon ("The people we love, we only borrowing them"), and the congregation's "Praise Jesus, Amen" exclamations. The author based her novel on stories passed down in Georgetown--tales of that area's first black churches, founded when people decided they wanted their own place of worship, and implicitly their own God. In church the novel takes flight. Elsewhere <i>River, Cross My Heart</i> suffers from clumsy, purple prose, and a plot that moves forward in labored fits and starts. Clarke painstakingly tries to re-create this past world, but sometimes it seems her duty to history is holding her back, bogging her down in period-piece details. In the effortless church scenes, history loses its gravity and is absorbed by grace. <i>--Emily White</i></p>Breena Clarke grew up in Washington, DC, and was educated at Webster College and Howard University.

The First Law (trilogy) is, I strongly believe, a seminal work of modern fantasy. It is a benchmark sequence that should be regarded as an example of all that is truly great in today's genre fiction. It stands way above the vast majority of the marketplace. It's damn good stuff!" -- <i>John Berylne, SF REVU</i><br><br>"He's written something not far short of a masterpiece, something special. Last Argument of Kings has everything you could ask for: huge battles, political intrigue, masterly characterisation and surprises by the bucket-load. This book will by turns shock you, excite you, make you laugh, and above all entertain you." -- <i>SPECULATIVE HORIZONS</i><br><br>"Last Argument of Kings delivers exactly what this trilogy needed: a no-holds-barred war story in which secrets are exposed, mysteries are explained and the author resolutely refuses to pull any punches. The ending is superb, particularly the tremendously satisfying epilogue and the final scene. Last Argument of Kings is a more than worthy conclusion to this trilogy." -- <i>THE WERTZONE</i><br><br>"Last Argument of Kings signs off the trilogy on a high, interspersing breathless skirmishes with thriller-like moments. You should always end with the best. Wow them in the final act, make the last chorus a belter, build to a climax and them get them on their feet applauding when the curtain falls. Last Argument of Kings is the textbook example of this theory in practice." -- <i>Dave Bradley, SFX</i><br><br>"Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say he knows how to close a trilogy with panache. The final novel in The First Law trilogy, Last Argument of Kings, is without a doubt the strongest novel in the cycle and, indeed, one of the strongest finishes to a trilogy I've come across in a long time. Joe Abercrombie has cemented himself at the top of the heap as one of the most consistent, fresh and exciting new voices in fantasy." -- <i>A DRIBBLE OF INK (website)</i><br><br>"The trilogy as a whole has crept gradually away from the standard fantasy template and gained a very unique feel. Having said this, for a book so different to Tolkien's, I'm going to make yet another Tolkien comparison - the aftermath and bittersweet ending has a very similar tone to the end of Lord of the Rings. each book in this trilogy has shown a distinct improvement, and with this fantastic concluding volume, I'd even go as far as to say it's become one of my favourite series." -- <i>SANDSTORM REVIEWS</i><br><br>All in all it has been one of the most incredible, twisted, inventive and above all utterly enjoyable fantasy reading experiences I've had in a very, very long time . . . Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say he knows how to tell a bloody good tale. -- <i>thegrenrefiles.com</i></p><h2>The 36-Hour Day, third edition, large print: The 36-Hour Day: A Family Guide to Caring for Persons with Alzheimer Disease, Related Dementing ...

So these two eloquent and readable guides will be much in demand as the number of families facing the challenge of caring for a relative with some form of dementing illness continues to grow. First published in 1981, The 36-Hour Day follows the format of the previous two editions but has been thoroughly updated to incorporate new information on the latest research, several drugs that hold promise, and genetic aspects of Alzheimer's. The heart of the guide remains unchanged, focusing on helping families cope with this progressive and irreversible disease. Besides tips on how to care for the demented during the various stages of the disease (for example, place a picture of a toilet on the bathroom door), the text discusses the different kinds of help available and how to seek it. Financial and legal issues are well covered, while sections on nursing homes and other alternative living arrangements provide advice and practical suggestions. Appendixes list recent books, videos, web sites, and U.S. and international organizations. The thrust of GentlecareR is a well-argued plea for a radical change in the way we care for Alzheimer's patients. In outlining her program, Jones states that this rethinking involves people, physical space, and individualized programs. Everyone in the physical plant, from maintenance worker to director, belongs to the care-giving team, as do family members and volunteers. Only when impaired persons can no longer perform for themselves a task like feeding themselves or dressing should it be done for them. Care should concentrate on what can be done, not what cannot. Because her emphasis is on the need for a comprehensive program of care and concentrates more on the institutional setting, Jones does not provide as many practical suggestions or the depth of advice for home care that Mace and Rabins do. Rather, her book describes how facilities can be designed and staffs trained to optimize the quality of life for patients. Both titles are highly recommended: Rabins and Mace for the practical help and advice, Jones for her eloquent presentation of a comprehensive program that treats patients with dignity.AJodith Janes, Cleveland Clinic Fdn. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Anything Is Possible</h2><p>Two sisters: One trades self-respect for a wealthy husband while the other finds, in the pages of a book, a kindred spirit who changes her life.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Strout</b> is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Olive Kitteridge;&nbsp;</i>the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>My Name Is Lucy Barton;</i>&nbsp;<i>The Burgess Boys,</i> a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller; <i>Abide with Me, </i>a national bestseller and Book Sense pick; and <i>Amy and Isabelle,</i> which won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction and the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> Heartland Prize.

Elizabeth Strout lives in New York City.The Sign<br><br>Tommy Guptill had once owned a dairy farm, which he&#x2019;d inherited from his father, and which was about two miles from the town of Amgash, Illinois. This was many years ago now, but at night Tommy still sometimes woke with the fear he had felt the night his dairy farm burned to the ground. The house had burned to the ground as well; the wind had sent sparks onto the house, which was not far from the barns. It had been his fault&#x2014;�he always thought it was his fault&#x2014;�because he had not checked that night on the milking machines to make sure they had been turned off properly, and this is where the fire started. Once it started, it ripped with a fury over the whole place. They lost everything, except for the brass frame to the living room mirror, which he came upon in the rubble the next day, and he left it where it was. A collection was taken up: For a number of weeks his kids went to school in the clothes of their classmates, until he could gather himself and the little money he had; he sold the land to the neighboring farmer, but it did not bring much money in. Then he and his wife, a short pretty woman named Shirley, bought new clothes, and he bought a house as well, Shirley keeping her spirits up admirably as all this was going on. They&#x2019;d had to buy a house in Amgash, which was a run-�down town, and his kids went to school there instead of in Carlisle, where they had been able to go to school before, his farm being just on the line dividing the two towns. Tommy took a job as the janitor in the Amgash school system; the steadiness of the job appealed to him, and he could never go to work on someone else&#x2019;s farm, he did not have the stomach for that. He was thirty-�five years old at the time.<br><br>The kids were grown now, with kids of their own who were also grown, and he and Shirley still lived in their small house; she had planted flowers around it, which was unusual in that town. Tommy had worried a good deal about his children at the time of the fire; they had gone from having their home be a place that class trips came to&#x2014;�each year in spring the fifth-�grade class from Carlisle would make a day of it, eating their lunches out beside the barns on the wooden tables there, then tromping through the barns watching the men milking the cows, the white foamy stuff going up and over them in the clear plastic pipes&#x2014;�to having to see their father as the man who pushed the broom over the &#x201c;magic dust&#x201d; that got tossed over the throw-�up of some kid who had been sick in the hallways, Tommy wearing his gray pants and a white shirt that had Tommy stitched on it in red.<br><br>Well. They had all lived through it.<br><br>This morning Tommy drove slowly to the town of Carlisle for errands; it was a sunny Saturday in May, and his wife&#x2019;s eighty-�second birthday was just a few days away. All around him were open fields, the corn newly planted, and the soybeans too. A number of fields were still brown, as they&#x2019;d been plowed under for their planting, but mostly there was the high blue sky, with a few white clouds scattered near the horizon. He drove past the sign on the road that led down to the Barton home; it still said SEWING AND ALTERATIONS, even though the woman, Lydia Barton, who did the sewing and alterations had died many years ago. The Barton family had been outcasts, even in a town like Amgash, their extreme poverty and strangeness making this so. The oldest child, a man named Pete, lived alone there now, the middle child was two towns away, and the youngest, Lucy Barton, had fled many years ago, and had ended up living in New York City. Tommy had spent time thinking of Lucy. All those years she had lingered after school, alone in a classroom, from fourth grade right up to her senior year in high school; it had taken her a few years to even look him in the eye.<br><br>But now Tommy was driving past the area where his farm had been&#x2014;�these days it was all fields, not a sign of the farm was left&#x2014;�and he thought, as he often thought, about his life back then. It had been a good life, but he did not regret the things that had happened. It was not Tommy&#x2019;s nature to regret things, and on the night of the fire&#x2014;�in the midst of his galloping fear&#x2014;�he understood that all that mattered in this world were his wife and his children, and he thought that people lived their whole lives not knowing this as sharply and constantly as he did. Privately, he thought of the fire as a sign from God to keep this gift tightly to him. Privately, because he did not want to be thought of as a man who made up excuses for a tragedy; and he did not want anyone&#x2014;�not even his dearly beloved wife&#x2014;�to think he would do this. But he had felt that night, while his wife kept the children over by the road&#x2014;�he had rushed them from the house when he saw that the barn was on fire&#x2014;�as he watched the enormous flames flying into the nighttime sky, then heard the terrible screaming sounds of the cows as they died, he had felt many things, but it was just as the roof of his house crashed in, fell into the house itself, right into their bedrooms and the living room below with all the photos of the children and his parents, as he saw this happen he had felt&#x2014;�undeniably&#x2014;�what he could only think was the presence of God, and he understood why angels had always been portrayed as having wings, because there had been a sensation of that&#x2014;�of a rushing sound, or not even a sound, and then it was as though God, who had no face, but was God, pressed up against him and conveyed to him without words&#x2014;�so briefly, so fleetingly&#x2014;�some message that Tommy understood to be: It&#x2019;s all right, Tommy. And then Tommy had understood that it was all right. It was beyond his understanding, but it was all right. And it had been. He often thought that his children had become more compassionate as a result of having to go to school with kids who were poor, and not from homes like the one they had first known. He had felt the presence of God since, at times, as though a golden color was very near to him, but he never again felt visited by God as he had felt that night, and he knew too well what people would make of it, and this is why he would keep it to himself until his dying day&#x2014;�the sign from God.<br><br>Still, on a spring morning as this one was, the smell of the soil brought back to him the smells of the cows, the moisture of their nostrils, the warmth of their bellies, and his barns&#x2014;�he had had two barns&#x2014;�and he let his mind roll over pieces of scenes that came to him. Perhaps because he had just passed the Barton place he thought of the man, Ken Barton, who had been the father of those poor, sad children, and who had worked on and off for Tommy, and then he thought&#x2014;�as he more often did&#x2014;�of Lucy, who had left for college and then ended up in New York City. She had become a writer.<br><br>Lucy Barton.<br><br>Driving, Tommy shook his head slightly. Tommy knew many things as a result of being the janitor in that school more than thirty years; he knew of girls&#x2019; pregnancies and drunken mothers and cheating spouses, for he overheard these things talked about by the students in their small huddles by the bathrooms, or near the cafeteria; in many ways he was invisible, he understood that. But Lucy Barton had troubled him the most. She and her sister, Vicky, and her brother, Pete, had been viciously scorned by the other kids, and by some of the teachers too. Yet because Lucy stayed after school so often for so many years he felt&#x2014;�though she seldom spoke&#x2014;�that he knew her the best. One time when she was in the fourth grade, it was his first year working there, he had opened the door to a classroom and found her lying on three chairs pushed together, over near the radiators, her coat as a blanket, fast asleep. He had stared at her, watching her chest move slightly up and down, seen the dark circles beneath her eyes, her eyelashes spread like tiny twinkling stars, for her eyelids had been moist as though she had been weeping before she slept, and then he backed out slowly, quietly as he could; it had felt almost unseemly to come upon her like that.<br><br>But one time&#x2014;�he remembered this now&#x2014;�she must have been in junior high school, and he&#x2019;d walked into the classroom and she was drawing on the blackboard with chalk. She stopped as soon as he stepped inside the room. &#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; he said. On the board was a drawing of a vine with many small leaves. Lucy moved away from the blackboard, then she suddenly spoke to him. &#x201c;I broke the chalk,&#x201d; she said. Tommy told her that was fine. &#x201c;I did it on purpose,&#x201d; she said, and there was a tiny glint of a smile before she looked away. &#x201c;On purpose?&#x201d; he asked, and she nodded, again with the tiny smile. So he went and picked up a piece of chalk, a full stick of it, and he snapped it in half and winked at her. In his memory she had almost giggled. &#x201c;You drew that?&#x201d; he asked, pointing to the vine with the small leaves. And she shrugged then and turned away. But usually, she was just sitting at a desk and reading, or doing her homework, he could see that she was doing that.<br><br>He pulled up to a stop sign now, and said the words aloud to himself quietly, &#x201c;Lucy, Lucy, Lucy B. Where did you go to, how did you flee?&#x201d;<br><br>He knew how. In the spring of her senior year, he had seen her in the hallway after school, and she had said to him, so suddenly open-�faced, her eyes big, &#x201c;Mr. Guptill, I&#x2019;m going to college!&#x201d; And he had said, &#x201c;Oh, Lucy. That&#x2019;s wonderful.&#x201d; She had thrown her arms around him; she would not let go, and so he hugged her back. He always remembered that hug, because she had been so thin; he could feel her bones and her small breasts, and because he wondered later how much&#x2014;�how little&#x2014;�that girl had ever been hugged.<br><br>Tommy pulled away from the stop sign and drove into the town; right there beyond was a parking space. Tommy pulled in to it, got out of his car, and squinted in the sunshine. &#x201c;Tommy Guptill,&#x201d; shouted a man, and, turning, Tommy saw Griff Johnson walking toward him with his characteristic limp, for Griff had one leg that was shorter than the other, and even his built-�up shoe could not keep him from limping. Griff had an arm out, ready to shake hands. &#x201c;Griffith,&#x201d; said Tommy, and they pumped their arms for a long time, while cars drove slowly past them down Main Street. Griff was the insurance man here in town, and he had been awfully good to Tommy; learning that Tommy had not insured his farm for its worth, Griff had said, &#x201c;I met you too late,&#x201d; which was true. But Griff, with his warm face, and big belly now, continued to be good to Tommy. In fact, Tommy did not know anyone&#x2014;�he thought&#x2014;�who was not good to him. As a breeze moved around them, they spoke of their children and grandchildren; Griff had a grandson who was on drugs, which Tommy thought was very sad, and he just listened and nodded, glancing up at the trees that lined Main Street, their leaves so young and bright green, and then he listened about another grandson who was in medical school now, and Tommy said, &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s just great, good for him,&#x201d; and they clapped hands on each other&#x2019;s shoulders and moved on.<br><br>In the dress shop, with its bell that announced his entrance, was Marilyn Macauley, trying on a dress. &#x201c;Tommy, what brings you in here?&#x201d; Marilyn was thinking of getting the dress for her granddaughter&#x2019;s baptism a few Sundays from now, she said, and she tugged on the side of it; it was beige with swirling red roses; she was without her shoes, standing in just her stockings. She said that it was an extravagance to buy a new dress for such a thing, but that she felt like it. Tommy&#x2014;�who had known Marilyn for years, first when she was in high school as a student in Amgash&#x2014;�saw her embarrassment, and he said he didn&#x2019;t think it was an extravagance at all. Then he said, &#x201c;When you have a chance, Marilyn, can you help me find something for my wife?&#x201d; He saw her become efficient then, and she said yes, she certainly would, and she went into the changing room and came back out in her regular clothes, a black skirt and a blue sweater, with her flat black shoes on, and right away she took Tommy over to the scarves. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, pulling out a red scarf that had a design with gold threads running through it. Tommy held it, but picked up a flowery scarf with his other hand. &#x201c;Maybe this,&#x201d; he said. And Marilyn said, &#x201c;Yes, that looks like Shirley,&#x201d; and then Tommy understood that Marilyn liked the red scarf herself but would never allow herself to buy it. Marilyn, that first year Tommy worked as a janitor, had been a lovely girl, saying &#x201c;Hi, Mr. Guptill!&#x201d; whenever she saw him, and now she had become an older woman, nervous, thin, her face pinched. Tommy thought what other people thought, it was because her husband had been in Vietnam and had never afterward been the same; Tommy would see Charlie Macauley around town, and he always looked so far away, the poor man, and poor Marilyn too. So Tommy held the red scarf with the gold threads for a minute as though considering it, then said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right, this one looks more like Shirley,&#x201d; and took the flowery one to the register. He thanked Marilyn for her help.<br><br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;ll love it,&#x201d; Marilyn said, and Tommy said he was sure she would.</p><h2>The Desert Road to Turkestan (Kodansha Globe)</h2><p>In inner Mongolia in 1927, when travel by rail had all but eclipsed the traditional camel caravan, Owen Lattimore embarked on the journey that would establish him as a legendary adventurer and leader among Asian scholars.

In a series of groundbreaking experiments, Dr. John Coates identified a feedback loop between testosterone and success that dramatically lowers the fear of risk in men, especially younger men&#x2014;significantly, the fear of risk is not reduced in women. Similarly, intense failure leads to a rise in levels of cortisol, the antitestosterone hormone that lowers the appetite for risk across an entire spectrum of decisions. <br><br>Coates had set out to prove what was already a strong intuition from his previous life: Before he became a world-class neuroscientist, Coates ran a derivatives desk in New York. As a successful trader on Wall Street, "the hour between dog and wolf" was the moment traders transformed-they would become revved up, exuberant risk takers, when flying high, or tentative, risk-averse creatures, when cowering from their losses. Coates understood instinctively that these dispositions were driven by body chemistry&#x2014;and then he proved it. <br><br><i>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</i> expands on Coates's own research to offer lessons from the entire exploding new field&#x2014;the biology of risk. He brings his research to life by telling a story of fictional traders who get caught up in a bubble and then a crash. As these traders place their bets and live with the results, Coates looks inside bodies to describe the physiology driving them into irrational exuberance and then pessimism. Risk concentrates the mind&#x2014;and the body&#x2014;like nothing else, altering our physiology in ways that have profound and lasting effects. What's more, biology shifts investors' risk preferences across the business cycle and can precipitate great change in the marketplace. <br><br>Though Coates's research concentrates on traders, his conclusions shed light on all types of high-pressure decision making-from the sports field to the battlefield. <i>The Hour Between Dog and Wolf </i>leaves us with a powerful recognition: To handle risk in a "highly evolved" way isn't a matter of mind over body; it's a matter of mind and body working together. We all have it in us to be transformed from dog into wolf; the only question is whether we can understand the causes and the consequences.</p><p><b>John Coates</b> is a senior research fellow in neuroscience and finance at the University of Cambridge.

Because of multiple revisions and the tight production schedule, the text of the first edition did not appear as Fitzgerald had intended. Now noted Fitzgerald biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli has produced the critical, accurate edition.</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Rex Wrecks It!</h2><p><b>Look out!

She lives with her family in Rochester, New York.<p>Kevin ripped the page out of his notebook and .crumpled it into a ball, making it as hard and tight as he could. Then he threw it straight up into the air and hit it with his open palm. Wham!<br> A perfect shot right into the wastebasket. The only good thing that had happened since he'd gotten home from school.<br> Monday was always his worst day. The weekend was over. Kevin's parents both worked late every Monday, so the house was empty when he got home. Sometimes&nbsp;<br> he liked being on his own, having&nbsp;the house to himself. But it was February, the bleakest part of winter, and the house felt cold, even with the heat on.<br> Today school had let out early--something about a half-day staff workshop--which was usually a good thing. But his best friend, Jason,&nbsp;had a dentist appointment and a guitar lesson, and couldn't hang out after school. The afternoon stretched ahead of Kevin, long and dreary.<br> Plus it seemed like the teachers always loaded up at some kind of giant homework depot over the weekend, unpacking&nbsp;tons of assignments every Monday. Kevin had already finished the math worksheet and answered the unit questions about ecosystems for science.<br> He'd saved the worst for last.<br> Social studies. Names and dates and places from ages ago. Boring, boringer, boringest.<br> It was a page of social-studies homework that was starting its new life in the wastebasket.<br> Kevin took off his baseball cap, scratched an itchy spot on his forehead, and pulled the cap on again. Then he saw his little rubber bouncy ball on the shelf above the desk. He picked it up and started a game of wall ball. The plunk of the ball against the wall made a steady beat. Thunk--thunk--thunk . . .<br> It wasn't--thunk--that he was bad at social studies. Not anywhere--thunk--close to failing. His grades&nbsp;were right in the middle of the class, pretty much where they were for all his other subjects, except for math. He did better at math, although you'd never know it from the way his dad checked his homework. His dad was a genius geek-head number-nerd whiz-brain computer programmer--super good at math. He seemed to know the answer before Kevin had even finished reading the problem. Whenever his dad tried to help him with math homework, it was as if they were speaking two different languages.<br> Still, math made sense. When you got the answer, you knew it was right; and when you were wrong, you could figure out the mistake. But social studies? Memorizing stuff that he'd never have any use for again, and having to write out answers to those awful essay questions,&nbsp;where right and wrong weren't clear. Well, no, not exactly--you could be wrong, that was for sure. But you could also be partly right or even mostly right and still get points taken off your answer.<br> Kevin sighed. He read the question in his social-<br> studies book again.<br> "Describe the relationship between King George III and the American colonists, and how this relationship led to the Revolutionary War."<br> Who cares! Kevin raged silently and put a little more into his throw. THUNK. The ball bounced harder against the wall. Why doesn't stupid King George mind his own business and leave me alone?<br> What difference did it make--thunk--what some old king or queen had done hundreds of years ago--thunk--<br> THUD!<br> The room shook, as if something heavy had fallen on the floor. Kevin missed the catch, and the ball bounced crazily around the room. He turned to see what had made the noise.<br> --twang--<br> --swish--<br> THWOCK!<br> "What the--?"<br> Now he could see what had made the thwock: An arrow hitting the wall above his desk.<br> An arrow that had pierced his baseball cap, lifted it clean off his head, and pinned it to the wall.<br> An arrow?<br> Then he heard a man's voice from somewhere on the other side of the room.<br> "Show me your hands, Strange One."<br> A grim voice.<br> "Stand--slowly--and show me your hands."<br> Kevin was too scared to do anything but obey. His knees were shaking as he stood up, turned toward the bed, and opened his hands in front of him. His hands were shaking, too. Stop it, he said silently. Somehow seeing them shake made him feel even more scared.<br> He forced himself to look toward where the voice had come from. About a quarter of a face--half a forehead and one wary eye--peeped out at him from behind the bed.<br> The owner of that eye was between Kevin and the door. In the&nbsp;next split second, about a billion thoughts ran through Kevin's head, so fast that it was like not thinking at all.<br> How the heck did he get in here?--no one else home--windows closed--no good yelling--call 911! Nearest phone in Mom and Dad's room--gotta&nbsp;get past him--gotta get out of here--<br> The man must have seen Kevin's eyes flicker toward the door.<br> "My arrow would end your life before you took a single step," he said. "Do not even think of fleeing.&nbsp;<br> And if you are armed, place your weapon on the floor. Now." The man rose from his crouch holding a bow--<br> a genuine bow-and-arrow bow. He wasn't aiming it at anything in particular, but he was clearly ready to aim if he had to.<br> If he aims it at me, I hope I don't pee in my pants.<br> "N-not armed," Kevin squeaked.<br> The man glared at him. "If you are lying, it will be the last lie you ever tell."<br> "Not lying!" Still a squeak, but a louder one.<br> Kevin could hardly breathe. He made himself take a chestful of air. Those cop shows on television--the victims of the&nbsp;crimes, lots of times they helped the police catch the criminals, didn't they? By giving a good description. . . . Okay, concentrate. Get a good look at this guy.<br> Asian. Long black hair loose around his shoulders. White jacket, baggy white pants. In his&nbsp;twenties, maybe. Kevin realized that he didn't usually think about adults' ages, so he wasn't very good at guessing. Not a teenager, but not as old as Kevin's parents.<br> A burglar . . . with a bow and arrows?<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Fearless Mind</h2><p>Life is a performance whether you re on the field, in the courtroom, or running a household.

Interlacing the life and work of this seminal twentieth-century philosopher, Julia Kristeva provides us with an elegant, sophisticated biography brimming with historical and philosophical insight.<br><br>Centering on the theme of female genius, <i>Hannah Arendt</i> emphasizes three features of the philosopher's work. First, by exploring Arendt's critique of Saint Augustine and her biographical essay on Rahel Varnhagen, Kristeva accentuates Arendt's commitment to recounting lives and narration. Second, Kristeva reflects on Arendt's perspective on<br><br>Judaism, anti-Semitism, and the "banality of evil." Finally, the biography assesses Arendt's intellectual journey, placing her enthusiasm for observing both social phenomena and political events in the context of her personal life.<br><br>Drawing on fragments of Arendt's most intimate correspondence with her longtime lover Martin Heidegger and her husband Heinrich Blucher, excerpts from her mother's "Unser Kind" (a diary tracking Hannah's formative years), and passages from Arendt's philosophical writings, Kristeva presents a luminous story. With a thorough thematic index and bibliographical references, <i>Hannah Arendt</i> is a major breakthrough in the understanding of an essential thinker.</p><p>Julia Kristeva's <i>Hannah Arendt</i> brings together two of the best minds in 20th-century philosophy; two who are especially noteworthy because they are visionary women in a field long dominated by men. Appropriately, the book is, in part, a tribute to Arendt, one of a series of looks at female genius. Kristeva brings her considerable scholarly arsenal, which includes linguistics, literary criticism, philosophy, feminism, aesthetics, cultural studies, and psychoanalysis. In particular, her psychoanalytic bent makes for an incisive look at Arendt because she was "gripped from the start by that unique passion in which life and thought are one.... [She] consistently put life--both life itself and life as a concept to be analyzed--at the center of her work." <p> Arendt is certainly one of the 20th century's brightest intellectual luminaries. Penning <i>The Human Condition</i> and <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i>, she wove her accounts of philosophy with a unique penchant for narrative and personal reflection, vivified by her extraordinary life. Throughout this biography, Kristeva plies Arendt's trade, using Arendt's life to illuminate her thought. By turns she examines Arendt's use of narrative, her ratiocinations on Jewish-ness and anti-Semitism, and her political philosophy. Kristeva's insightfulness in this volume will help ensure her a place in the canon alongside Arendt. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>Centering on the theme of female genius, Hannah Arendt emphasizes three features of the philosopher&#39;s work.

What cannot be done by men, or by individual women, can be done by women together. Earth is Home.&#34; Jean Shinoda Bolen&#39;s life&#39;s work -- her Jungian-inspired insights in The Tao of Psychology, the blockbuster Goddesss in Every Woman, the empowering Crones Don&#39;t Whine and The Millionth Circle -- all lead up to this book. It is an urgent message and an empowering one. &#34;When women are strong together, women can be fiercely protective of what we love.&#34; Bolen&#39;s poetic polemic explores the psychological, spiritual, and scientific aspects of women as collaborators for change. She begins with a Jungian examination of the idea of the Holy Grail archetype as &#34;every woman&#39;s secret&#34; and the transformative power of the sacred feminine -- the Goddess, Gaia, Earth Mother. Bolen explains Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s Theory of Morphic Resonance, which describes how societies and even species can undergo rapid evolution when they reach a tipping point. She explains that &#34;we&#39;ve learned that women gathering together in groups and telling the truth of their lives can actually change the world.&#34; She points to a fascinating UCLA study proving that women react to stress differently than their male counterparts. Instead of the &#34;fight or flight&#34; reaction, women have a &#34;tend and befriend&#34; response as a result of an increase in oxytocin, the maternal bonding hormone. While men become more adrenalized and aggressive, women nurture and protect -- biologically. From this and other compelling evidence Bolen makes a strongly convincing case that now is the time for women to lead -- to fiercely protect all that we love. Urgent Message from Mother offers a unique combination of visionary thinking and practical how-to and is Jean Shinoda Bolen&#39;s most activist work to-date. Written in a lyrical language that inspires, this book seeks to galvanize the still untapped power of women coming together to change our world. Listen to your mother; she is calling.</p><p>"Jean Shinoda Bolen&#x2019;s Urgent Message from Mother is a book whose time has come. Our earth home and all forms of life in it are at grave risk. We men have had our turn and made a proper mess of things. We need women to save us. I pray that many will read Bolen&#x2019;s work and be inspired then to act appropriately. Time is running out." <p>&#x2014; Desmond Tutu "This is the most inspiring and optimistic book I&#x2019;ve read in years. It tells how women working together can bring us peace and save the planet.

Jean never tires of wanting, and working for, our freedom, our healing and our health." &#x2014;Alice Walker "Jean Shinoda Bolen shows us how the cult of masculinity is endangering us all. Women and men are equally human and fallible but at least women don&#x2019;t have our masculinity to prove&#x2014;and that alone may make us the main saviors of this fragile Spaceship Earth."</p><p>&#x2014;Gloria Steinem Urgent Message from Mother is a heart-shaking book which offers a powerful vision of why the world must change and how such a pivotal undertaking might be accomplished.

This book brought me back to my spiritual center reminding me how much we need the stories of women to restore empathy to the world. Bolen has given us all an assignment: Gather, circle, act. Mother Earth is asking for our help. How can we not respond?" </p><p>&#x2014;Terry Tempest Williams, author of The Open Space of Democracy "An inspiring call to action, powered by real examples of how women can save the world."</p><p>&#x2014;Gloria Feldt, author of The War on Choice : The Right-Wing Attack on Women&#x2019;s Rights and How to Fight Back and former president, Planned Parenthood Federation of America "If Jean Shinoda Bolen says, &#x2018;Gather the women,&#x2019; I&#x2019;m there. Urgent Message from Mother is a call to the deepest womanself&#x2014;our passion, our wisdom, our intelligence, our love.

Bravo!" &#x2014;Marianne Williamson, author of A Return to Love "Urgent Message from Mother is a passionate book, a call from the heart.

Powers's <i>Morte D'Urban</i> has had a checkered commercial history from the very start. The original publisher failed to reprint the novel after it won the 1963 National Book Award, and although it's had various paperback reincarnations since then, these too have tended to disappear from the shelves. Perhaps <i>any</i> novel about Catholic priests in the Protestant Midwest would be in for some tough sledding. Still, it's hard to think of a funnier piece of writing, or one more accurately attuned to the deadpan rhythms of American speech. Doubters need only consult Father Urban's sermons, which mix pure banality and theological hairsplitting in such exact proportions as to suggest Babbitt in a clerical collar. Yet Powers also manages a kind of last-minute legerdemain, transforming his satiric romp into a deadly serious, and deeply moving, exploration of faith.<p> The satire, of course, is itself worth the price of admission. Poor Father Urban, mired in a 10th-rate religious order! </p><blockquote> It seemed to him that the Order of St. Clement labored under the curse of mediocrity, and had done so almost from the beginning. In Europe, the Clementines hadn't (it was always said) recovered from the French Revolution. It was certain that they hadn't ever really got going in the New World. Their history revealed little to brag about--one saint (the Holy Founder) and a few bishops of missionary sees, no theologians worthy of the name, no original thinkers, not even a scientist. The Clementines were unique in that they were noted for nothing at all. </blockquote> The clash between this ecclesiastical overachiever and his underachieving brethren never loses its comedic charge. It also occasions plenty of politicking and ex cathedra combat, involving not only the Clementines but various diocesan heavyweights. Who will win this holy war? When Father Urban lures unbelievers to the order's Minnesota property with a world-class golf course--complete with a "shrine of Our Lady below No. 5 green"--his triumph seems assured. Yet his ability to balance between the secular and the sacred is what ultimately collapses, along with his "secret ascendancy over the life around him." In an age when fiction seems to have lost some of its power to instruct and amuse (and not necessarily in that order), <i>Morte D'Urban</i> is brilliant enough to make believers of us all. <i>--James Marcus</i>J.

On that day, 27,000 young French soldiers died - the bloodiest day in the military history of France (most of them in the Ardennes) - and yet it is almost unknown to English-speaking readers. There has never been an operational study of the Battle of the Ardennes in any language: at best, a single chapter in a history of greater scope; at least a monograph of an individual tactical encounter within the overall battle. This book fills a glaring gap in the study of the opening phase of the First World War - the Battles of the Frontiers - and provides fresh insight into both French and German plans for the prosecution of what was supposed to be a short war. At the center of this book lies a mystery: in a key encounter battle, one French Army corps led by a future Minister of War - General Pierre Roques - outnumbered its immediate opposition by nearly six to one and yet dismally failed to capitalize on that superiority. The question is how, and why. Intriguingly, there is a six-hour gap in the war diaries of all General Roques&#x2019; units; it smacks of a cover-up. By a thorough investigation of German sources, and through the discovery of three vital messages buried in the French archives, it is now possible to piece together what happened during those missing hours and show how Roques threw away an opportunity to break the German line and advance unopposed deep into the hinterland beyond. The chimera of a clean break and exploitation that was to haunt the Allied High Command for the next four years in the trenches of the Western Front, was a brief and tantalizing opportunity for General Roques. The final part of this book seeks to answer the question 'why?' The history of both French and German prewar preparation reveals the political, economic and cultural differences that shaped the two opposing national armies. Those differences, in turn, predicated the behavior of General Roques and his men, as well as that of his German opponent. With a clear understanding of those differences, the reader may now understand how the French lost their best opportunity not only to stymie the Schlieffen Plan, but to change the course of the rest of the war. The author's text is supported by a separate map book containing c 50 newly commissioned color maps.</p><p>Simon House is an independent military historian - and Lost Opportunity is his first book. It is the book of his doctoral thesis, gained at Kings College London in May 2012 under the supervision of Professor William Philpott (Bloody Victory and Attrition) and examined by Professor Sir Hew Strachan and Professor David Stevenson. Despite a lifelong passion for military history, Simon came to the profession late in life - having fitted in a 32-year career as an accountant and senior executive at British Telecom before retiring in 2001 to pursue other interests. One of those interests was, of course, military history, which took him to the reading rooms of the Imperial War Museum. There he used his French and German-language skills to research the Battles of the Frontiers. Whilst translating the French Official History&#x2019;s version of the Battle of the Ardennes, his eye was drawn to a copy of the German History - Der Weltkrieg - which when translated, gave a very different story of the battle. There followed nearly 10 years of painstaking research to unearth the truth about this little-known and misunderstood battle. Simon is 65 years old and is married with three sons. He has six grandchildren and (so far) two great-grandchildren. He lives in Southampton (the UK one) and is currently researching for his second book: this time on the subject of the &#x2018;tipping points&#x2019; of the Second World War.&#x201c;A very thoroughly researched description and analysis of both sides' efforts...Yet another attractive addition to the Helion stable of specialist military studies.&#x201d; (<i>Miniature Wargames</i>)<br><br>&#x201c; ...

Vollmann has travelled to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan with Islamic commandos, shivered out a solitary stretch at the North Magnetic Pole in winter, hopped freight trains, studied the stately ancient beauties of Japanese Noh theater, and made friends with street prostitutes all over the world&#x2014;all in the interest of learning a little more about life. Now in his mid-fifties, Vollmann sets out on what may well be impossible for a heterosexual genetic male: to envision himself as a woman. In these photographs, block prints, and watercolor drawings, he portrays his alter ego, Dolores, with whimsicality, and sometimes with cruelty&#x2014;for Dolores would like to be attractive, or at least to &#x201c;pass,&#x201d; but the ageing male body in which she remains confined requires lowered expectations. Meanwhile, the drawings and block prints, composed with the artist&#x2019;s glasses off, show Dolores as she imagines herself to be. <b><i>The Book of Dolores</i></b> brings the genre of self-portraits to a new level of vulnerability and bravery. In the process, it offers virtuoso performances of nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first-century photographic techniques, including the seductively difficult gum bichromate method. Each section of the book is accompanied by an essay on motives and techniques.</p><p><b>William T. Vollmann</b> was born in California in 1959. He has worked as a journalist for BBC Radio, <i>The New Yorker, Spin, Granta, The Los Angeles Times</i>, and other venues.

Although many of Vollmann&#x2019;s books and articles contain his photographs and drawings, the first work exclusively devoted to his photography was <i>Imperial,</i> which powerHouse published in 2008 (while Viking brought out an accompanying text volume of the same name)."Whether or not it turns him on, whether or not it makes him feel more like, or better than, himself, becoming Dolores in words and images gives Vollmann one more way to say that his own world is what he can make it."<br><b>-Stephen Burt, <i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"Indeed, many of the images in &#x201c;The Book of Dolores&#x201d; have a garish sideshow quality: Dolores with whip and dog collar; Dolores with a noose around her neck; Dolores as a deranged clown...The results are shocking &#x2014;&nbsp;a sense of shock that Mr. Vollmann cultivates.

Find out how you can avoid becoming a statistic.</p><p>As a respected physician and pioneer in the field of complementary medicine, Dr. Robert C. Atkins recognized early on that diabetes and obesity are twin epidemics, and that the way to reverse both is to permanently change the way people eat. Yet much of the mainstream medical establishment continues to advocate the treatment of diabetes with insulin and other drugs, while recommending a diet high in carbohydrates including sugar, which raises your blood sugar. What you'll learn from reading <em>Atkins Diabetes Revolution</em> is that rather than correcting your metabolism, such a diet can actually increase your risk of developing diabetes&#x2014;and heart disease.</p><p>The Atkins Blood Sugar Control Program (ABSCP) helps you identify the metabolic signposts that indicate trouble long before the onset of Type 2 diabetes so you can stop it in its tracks. If you already have the disease, the ABSCP offers you and your physician a strategy for weight management and blood-sugar control, while minimizing your exposure to drugs.</p><p><em>Atkins Diabetes Revolution</em> presents a comprehensive lifestyle program, including diet, exercise, and nutrient supplementation. The book also contains meal plans, recipes, a fitness routine, and case studies. This revolutionary book, a fitting tribute to Dr. Atkins, tackles one of the greatest health challenges you and your family may ever face.</p></p><p>Two colleagues of the late Dr. Robert Atkins take on the obesity epidemic's deadly twin: type 2 diabetes. Dr. Mary Vernon and Jacqueline Eberstein, RN, adapt the carb-cutting, fat-allowing Atkins nutritional approach as a preemptive strike against this fast-growing killer. Diabetes--defined here as a condition in which glucose or blood sugar is above the normal range--is viewed as a preventable problem. "What we hope we have created in this book is a realistic and practical guide to wiping out type 2, one person at a time." Since obesity is the major risk factor for diabetes, they begin with the "fat lie" (i.e., the belief that fat causes obesity) to voice the Atkins mantra: low fat means high carbs and high carbs are broken down into sugar. With a convincing mix of essay/picture testimonials, clinical studies, quizzes, checklists, and menu planners and recipes, Vernon and Eberstein make the case for diet and lifestyle changes to alter the metabolism of those at risk for diabetes. They have done a yeoman's job of translating Atkins's medical nutrition advice into a step-by-step program. One can quibble about their missionary zeal or the omnipresent eggs in the breakfast sample menus. At times, the scientific data are overly detailed or hidden within a quiz. Thankfully, there is a spot-on summary of the book's paradigm-busting ideas in the appendix. <i>-- Barbara Mackoff</i><p>Robert C. Atkins, M.D., was the founder and Executive Medical Director of The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York City. His groundbreaking weight loss book, <em>Diet Revolution</em>, was the first major work to prescribe a low-carbohydrate diet. The revised and updated <em>Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution</em> spent more than six years on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list.</p></p><h2>The Strangler&#39;s Honeymoon (The Van Veeteren series)</h2><p>Desperately lonely, sixteen-year-old Monica Kammerle has little idea of what she is getting herself into when she begins an affair with her mother s latest partner; the sophisticated Benjamin Kerran . . . Months later, when a woman s strangled body is found, the Maardam police must discover who has committed this terrible crime. It isn t long before they realize the perpetrator may have killed before and is likely to do so again. Meanwhile former Chief Inspector Van Veeteren finds himself drawn into the mystery when a priest, who has learned dreadful secrets, appeals to him for help.

For Peter Guber, what began as a knack for telling stories as one of the world's leading entertainment executives has evolved into a set of principles that anyone can use to achieve their goals - whatever you do in life, you need to be able to tell a good story. </p><p>In<i> Tell to Win </i>Guber explains how to move beyond PowerpPoint slides and spreadsheets to create purposeful stories that can serve as powerful calls to action. He reveals the best way to get noticed, how to turn passive listeners into active participants, and how technology can be used to ensure audience commitment. Featuring wisdom from Guber's meetings with (and lessons from) everyone from Nelson Mandela to YouTube founder Chad Hurley, and Muhammed Ali to Steven Spielberg (who he tutored in making films), <i>Tell to Win </i>entertainingly shows how to craft, deliver and own a story that is capable of turning others into viral advocates for your goal.</p></p><p><b>Guest Reviewer: Tony Hsieh</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Tony Hsieh is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Delivering Happiness</i> and CEO of Zappos.com, Inc. <p></p> In less than 10 years, Zappos has grown from no sales in 1999 to over a billion dollars in gross merchandise sales annually. Our philosophy is to take most of the money that we would have otherwise spent on paid advertising or paid marketing and instead invest it into customer service and the customer experience, and let our customers do the marketing for us through word of mouth. <p></p> In other words, we're really just in the stories and memories business. <p></p> From an early age, Peter Guber seems to have intuitively grasped what I slowly learned over my entrepreneurial adventures, which is that the most profitable companies are those that form personal, emotional connections (which we internally refer to as "PEC" at Zappos) with customers. In <i>Tell to Win</i>, Guber shows how the stories we tell -- about our companies, our products, and ourselves -- are what elicit people's emotional reactions and drive word of mouth. <p></p> The book includes plenty of examples and guidance for breaking down how a story gets created and delivered. As I read through the book, I repeatedly had to put the book down to think for awhile, because so many stories in the book sparked new ideas on how to improve our business at Zappos. <p></p> I hope this book inspires you to create your own "never-ending story" to help take your business to the next level. <p></p><b>PETER GUBER</b> has had an extraordinarily varied and successful career, serving as Studio Chief at Columbia Pictures; Co-Chairman of Casablanca Records and Filmworks; CEO of Polygram Entertainment; Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures; and Chairman and CEO of his current venture, Mandalay Entertainment Group. &nbsp;Among the award-winning films he has produced or executive produced are &#x201c;Midnight Express,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Color Purple,&#x201d; &#x201c;Gorillas in the Mist,&#x201d; &#x201c;Batman,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Rain Man.&#x201d; Guber is the co-owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and oversees one of the largest combinations of professional baseball teams and venues nationwide.

A microcosm of World War II exists in the rise and fall of this famous fighter wing--whose slashing attacks always seemed to come from the best position--from its founding during Hitler's military buildup, through its glory days in the first years of the war--when its bases in northen France were to be avoided at all costs--right up to the grim, final hours of the Third Reich.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>DONALD CALDWELL is a retired research chemist and veteran of the US Navy. For the past 25 years he has researched archival sources and interviewed veterans, primarily from the Luftwaffe. His first book, JG 26: Top Guns of the Luftwaffe, has been followed by seven others on the Luftwaffe: all have won critical and popular acclaim.Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wing) 26, the German elite fighter unit, was more feared by the Allies than any other Luftwaffe group. Based on extensive archival research in Europe, personal combat diaries and interviews with more than 50 surviving pilots, Caldwell here assembles a superb day-to-day chronicle of JG26 operations, from its first air victory in 1939 to its final combat patrol in 1945. For the first two years of the war it was an even match between the Spitfires and Hurricanes of the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe's Messerschmitts and Focke Wulfs; but--as the author reveals in meticulous detail--the scales tipped in favor of the Allies in 1943 with the arrival of the Eighth U.S. Air Force and its peerless P-51 Mustang. In his first book, Caldwell, a research chemist, describes how the German pilots' morale remained high even after it was obvious to all but the youngest and most naive that the war was lost.seems obvious? The ultimate recommendation comes from Adolf Galland, legendary Messerschmitt pilot and commanding officer of Fighter Wing 26, who in the foreword calls JG26 "a profound book, written in full fairness."

More than five thousand men and women went to work at the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, and began what they thought was just another routine day at the office. Many of them had likely gotten a cup of coffee, sat down at their desks, rolled up their sleeves, booted up their computers, and begun placing telephone calls. None of them had any indication that within the hour they would step into eternity. For them, death came as a thief in the night. </p><p>For others, death can come as a longed-for and welcomed relief. Within a three-week period, while I was in the midst of writing this book, I attended both the funeral of my husband&#x2019;s beloved brother, John Lotz, and the funeral of my father&#x2019;s associate T. W. Wilson, who was like a second father to me. John died as a result of a fast-growing, malignant brain tumor. &#x201c;Uncle T&#x201d; died from massive heart failure at the grand old age of eighty-two. For both John and Uncle T, death came as an angel of mercy. </p><p>Regardless of how or when it comes, <i>death does come</i> for each of us. And each of us wonders: <i>When will it come for my loved one? What will it be like for me?</i> </p><p>For the past thirteen years I have traveled all over the world in response to invitations to give out God&#x2019;s Word. There have been times, such as my first visit to India, when I have started out by climbing onto the plane with my stomach churning, my knees knocking, and my heart fibrillating&#x2014;terrified because I was not sure where I was going, or who would meet me at the journey&#x2019;s end. But what a difference there has been in my attitude when I have had the opportunity for a second visit to that same place. I have left home with peace in my heart because I knew where I was going and who would meet me at the journey&#x2019;s end. In the same way, the prospect of death can fill you and me with terror and dread&#x2014;unless we know where we are going. Knowing as much as we can about our final destination, and Who will meet us at the end of life&#x2019;s journey, takes the fear out of getting there. <br> &nbsp; Hope for Today </p><p>Picture an old man, living on a remote island.

He and his brother James were the sons of Zebedee who earlier had been called the sons of thunder because they had such fiery tempers.

And he paid a high price for his well-known and outspoken relationship with the One he believed to be the Messiah, the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth. </p><p>Exiled to the island of Patmos in the midst of the Aegean Sea, the apostle John knew he would be facing death in the not-too-distant future. This was the very moment in time when God chose to give John a vision of the glory of Jesus Christ! This vision included a tantalizing glimpse into Heaven, where one day God Himself will live forever with His people. This glorious vision has been recorded in the final book of the Bible, Revelation, because John was commanded to write down what he saw. The vision was to be not only for his own personal comfort and encouragement but for all people down through the centuries who, when facing daily challenges, extraordinary circumstances, or even when plunging to certain death, could do so with courage and <i>with hop</i>e. <br> &nbsp; Hope for Tomorrow </p><p>Are you facing the future with eyes wide shut, teeth clenched, body tensed, dreading your tomorrows and what they may hold?

A painter and a sculptor, his work centers around farms, animals, architecture, and folklore. He lives in the tiny village of Narrowsburg, New York, in the Catskill Mountains.</p>A folk-art quality infuses Dunrea's clean-lined and pleasing gouache illustrations for this highly appealing biography from Brenner (The Earth is Painted Green, 1994, etc.) on the childhood of America's first world-famous artist, Benjamin West. Later in life, West would enjoy the patronage of King George III and friendships with men such as Benjamin Franklin, but the boy growing up on a Pennsylvania farm in the tag end of a family of ten showed few signs of what he would become. Three chapters relate pivotal moments in West's boyhood; in the first, Benjamin is given the duty of rocking the cradle and flapping the flies away from a baby, but is seized by an intense desire to draw the child instead, resulting in an astonishingly recognizable drawing. A nicely executed section, ``And Then What Happened?'' collapses the rest of an illustrious career into two spreads, one of which provides some of the artist's paintings, including his first, Landscape with Cow. A concluding spread simply and briefly provides bibliographic data. The glimpses of the artist's development in this handsome book provides may be apocryphal autobiography from West himself (Brenner bases her incidents on his account of his childhood), but the charm and innocence of his delinquencies will attract readers.

Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. </p><p>Edward P.

Jones's debut novel, <i>The Known World</i>, is a masterpiece of overlapping plot lines, time shifts, and heartbreaking details of life under slavery. Caldonia Townsend is an educated black slaveowner, the widow of a well-loved young farmer named Henry, whose parents had bought their own freedom, and then freed their son, only to watch him buy himself a slave as soon as he had saved enough money. Although a fair and gentle master by the standards of the day, Henry Townsend had learned from former master about the proper distance to keep from one's property. After his death, his slaves wonder if Caldonia will free them. When she fails to do so, but instead breaches the code that keeps them separate from her, a little piece of Manchester County begins to unravel. Impossible to rush through, <i>The Known World</i> is a complex, beautifully written novel with a large cast of characters, rewarding the patient reader with unexpected connections, some reaching into the present day. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>Edward P.

Curious George is among the nine little monkeys playing with Cecily G.</p><p><p>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. Hans Augusto Rey (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, Margret (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G.

National ad/promo.</p><p>In a career that spanned six decades, Ansel Adams was at once America's foremost landscape photographer and one of its most ardent environmentalists. <br><br>James Enyeart is the Director of the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House. Formerly director of the Center for Creative Photography, he is the author of Decade by Decade: 20th Century American Photography(NYGS, 1989).Adams died in 1984, still planning a book on color photography, a topic that he had wrestled with since the 1950s and that gave him profound discomfort. He allowed that were he a young photographer in the 1980s, he'd work in color, yet in the last letter quoted herein he confessed, "I don't like photographic color. . . . It is not my dish of tea!" In other remarks, he was more analytic about color's challenges. Mostly, he regretted lack of control over intensity and hue, which afforded him no way to transform color as he transformed and exaggerated tonal values in black-and-white. For Adams, black-and-white was an abstract medium and color was inseparable from banal realism. He also sensed in himself a lack of "color imagination," the quality that distinguished the work of his colleague and friend Eliot Porter. He was right, yet he produced 3,000 color transparencies, most as tests for Kodak or for 1940s and 1950s commercial jobs. Eminent color photographer Harry Callahan culled 59 landscapes from this work for this album, which thoroughgoing photography collections will want in order to document Adams' beliefs about color photography and as testimony to the problems color has presented as a creative medium. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>Monday with a Mad Genius (Magic Tree House, No. 38)</h2><p><p>Jack and Annie are on a mission to save Merlin from his sorrows!

Ronald Lewis explores the transformation in these mountain counties precipitated by deforestation. As the only state that lies entirely within the Appalachian region, West<br>Virginia provides an ideal site for studying the broader social impact of deforestation in Appalachia, the South, and the eastern United States.<br><br>Most of West Virginia was still dominated by a backcountry economy when the industrial transition began. In short order, however, railroads linked remote mountain settlements directly to<br>national markets, hauling away forest products and returning with manufactured goods and modern ideas. Workers from the countryside and abroad swelled new mill towns, and merchants ventured into<br>the mountains to fulfill the needs of the growing population. To protect their massive investments, capitalists increasingly extended control over the state's legal and political systems. <br><br>Eventually, though, even ardent supporters of industrialization had reason to contemplate the consequences of unregulated exploitation. Once the timber was gone, the mills closed and the railroads pulled up their tracks, leaving behind an environmental disaster and a new class of marginalized rural poor to confront the worst depression in American history.<br><br></p><p>"A major scholar of Appalachian history has brought together, synthesized and made sense of much of the debate and literature that have characterized the field of Appalachian history for the past two decades. . . .

What truly governs the Major League game is a set of unwritten rules, some of which are openly discussed (don&#x2019;t steal a base with a big lead late in the game), and some of which only a minority of players are even aware of (don&#x2019;t cross between the catcher and the pitcher on the way to the batter&#x2019;s box). In <i>The Baseball Codes</i>, old-timers and all-time greats share their insights into the game&#x2019;s most hallowed&#x2014;and least known&#x2014;traditions. For the learned and the casual baseball fan alike, the result is illuminating and thoroughly entertaining. <br>&nbsp;<br>At the heart of this book are incredible and often hilarious stories involving national heroes (like Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays) and notorious headhunters (like Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale) in a century-long series of confrontations over respect, honor, and the soul of the game. With <i>The Baseball Codes</i>, we see for the first time the game as it&#x2019;s actually played, through the eyes of the players on the field.<br>&nbsp;<br>With rollicking stories from the past and new perspectives on baseball&#x2019;s informal rulebook, <i>The Baseball Codes</i> is a must for every fan.</p><p><b>JASON TURBOW</b>&#x2019;s writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times, </i>Sports Illustrated.com, <i>Slam Magazine</i>, <i>Popular Science</i>, and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and he is a regular contributor to <i>Giants Magazine </i>and <i>A&#x2019;s Magazine</i>.

He lives in the Bay Area.<b>Chapter 7<br></b><br><i>Don&#x2019;t Show Players Up</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>It was a simple question. From the batter&#x2019;s box at Candlestick Park, Willie Mays looked at Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford and, pointing toward Mickey Mantle in center field, asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that crazy b**tard clapping about?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>What that crazy b**tard was clapping about only tangentially concerned Mays, but the Giants superstar didn&#x2019;t know that at the time. It was the 1961 All-Star Game, and Ford had just struck Mays out, looking, to end the first inning. The question was posed when Ford passed by Mays as the American League defense returned to the dugout&#x2014;most notably among them Mantle, hopping and applauding every step of the way, as if his team had just won the World Series. There was a good story behind it, but that didn&#x2019;t much matter in the moment. Willie Mays was being shown up in front of a national baseball audience. <br>&nbsp;<br>Under ordinary circumstances there is no acceptable reason for a player to embarrass one of his colleagues on the field. It&#x2019;s the concept at the core of the unwritten rules, helping dictate when it is and isn&#x2019;t appropriate to steal a base, how one should act in the batter&#x2019;s box after hitting a home run, and what a player should or shouldn&#x2019;t say to the media. Nobody likes to be shown up, and baseball&#x2019;s Code identifies the notion in virtually all its permutations. Mantle&#x2019;s display should never have happened, and Mays knew it. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mantle had been joyous for a number of reasons. There was the strikeout itself, which was impressive because to that point Mays had hit Ford like he was playing slow-pitch softball&#x2014;6-for-6 lifetime, with two homers, a triple, and an astounding 2.167 slugging percentage, all in All- Star competition. Also, Ford and Mantle had spent the previous night painting the town in San Francisco in their own inimitable way, and Ford, still feeling the effects of overindulgence, was hoping simply to survive the confrontation. Realizing that he had no idea how to approach a Mays at-bat, the left-hander opened with a curveball; Mays responded by pummeling the pitch well over four hundred feet, just foul. Ford, bleary and already half beaten, didn&#x2019;t see a downside to more of the same, and went back to the curve. This time Mays hit it nearly five hundred feet, but again foul. It became clear to the pitcher that he couldn&#x2019;t win this battle straight up&#x2014;so he dipped into his bag of tricks. <br>&nbsp;<br>Though Ford has admitted to doctoring baseballs in later years, at that point in his career he wasn&#x2019;t well practiced in the art. Still, he was ahead in the count, it was an exhibition game, and Mays was entitled to at least one more pitch. Without much to lose, Ford spat on his throwing hand, then pretended to wipe it off on his shirt. When he released the ball, it slid rotation-free from between his fingers and sailed directly at Mays&#x2019;s head, before dropping, said Ford, &#x201c;from his chin to his knees&#x201d; through the strike zone. Mays could do nothing but gape and wait for umpire Stan Landes to shoot up his right hand and call strike three. <br>&nbsp;<br>To this point in the story, nobody has been shown up at all. Ford may have violated baseball&#x2019;s actual rules by loading up a spitter, but cheating is fairly well tolerated within the Code. Mays&#x2019;s reaction to the extreme break of the pitch may have made him look bad, but that was hardly Ford&#x2019;s fault. But then came Mantle, jumping and clapping like a kid who&#x2019;d just been handed tickets to the circus. It didn&#x2019;t much matter that the spectacle was directed not at Mays but at Giants owner Horace Stoneham, who immediately understood the motivation behind Mantle&#x2019;s antics. <br>&nbsp;<br>Stoneham had gone out of his way to make Mantle and Ford feel at home upon their arrival in town a day earlier, using his connections at the exclusive Olympic Club to arrange a round of golf for the duo, and went so far as to enlist his son Peter as their chauffeur. Because the pair of Yankees had failed to bring golf equipment, their first stop was the pro shop, for shoes, gloves, sweaters, and rental clubs. The total came to four hundred dollars, but the club didn&#x2019;t accept cash. Instead, they charged everything to Stoneham, intending to pay him back at the ballpark the following day. <br>&nbsp;<br>That night, however, the three met at a party at the chic Mark Hopkins Hotel. Ford attempted to settle his tab on the spot, but Stoneham&#x2019;s response wasn&#x2019;t quite what he anticipated: The owner told him to keep his money . . . for the moment. Stoneham then proposed a wager: If Ford retired Mays the first time they faced each other the following afternoon, he owed nothing. Should the center fielder hit safely, however, Ford and Mantle would owe Stoneham eight hundred dollars, double their original debt. Ordinarily, this sort of bet would be weighted heavily in favor of the pitcher, since even the best hitters connect only three times out of ten, but Ford was aware of his track record against Mays. Nonetheless, the lefty loved a challenge even more than he loved a drink, and quickly accepted Stoneham&#x2019;s terms. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mantle, however, wasn&#x2019;t so cavalier, telling Ford frankly just how bad a deal it was. &#x201c;I hated to lose a sucker bet,&#x201d; he said later, &#x201c;and this was one of them.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That didn&#x2019;t keep Ford from sweet-talking him into accepting Stoneham&#x2019;s terms. In center field the next day, Mantle found himself significantly more concerned about the potential four-hundred-dollar hole in his pocket than he was about the baseball ramifications of the Ford-Mays showdown. So, when the Giants&#x2019; star was called out on the decisive spitter, it was all Mantle could do to keep from pirouetting across the field. Said Ford, &#x201c;Here it was only the end of the first inning in the All-Star Game, and he was going crazy all the way into the dugout.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t dawn on me right away how it must have looked to Willie and the crowd,&#x201d; said Mantle. &#x201c;It looked as if I was all tickled about Mays striking out because of the big rivalry [over who was the game&#x2019;s pre-eminent center fielder], and in the dugout when Whitey mentioned my reaction I slapped my forehead and sputtered, &#x2018;Aw, no . . . I didn&#x2019;t . . . how could I . . . what a dumb thing.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>That Mantle got away with it was largely due to the fact that Ford later explained the entire affair to Mays, much to May&#x2019;s amusement. In this regard, Mantle was luckier than most players, who usually learn of their indiscretions from well-placed fastballs, not from conversation. For example, stepping out of the batter&#x2019;s box once a pitcher comes set isn&#x2019;t something that inspires retribution in most pitchers, but it did for Goose Gossage&#x2014;in a spring-training game, no less. And Randy Johnson drilled a player in a B-squad game for swinging too hard. New York Mets closer Billy Wagner considered hitting a spring-scrimmage opponent from the University of Michigan who had the nerve to bunt on him. (&#x201c;Play to win against Villanova,&#x201d; the pitcher said afterward.) Nolan Ryan felt similarly when major-leaguers laid down bunts against him, and Don Drysdale and Bob Gibson were likely to knock down any opponent who dug in. All these pitchers felt justified in meting out justice for infractions that the majority of their colleagues barely noticed. <br>&nbsp;<br>Several code violations, however, are universally abhorred. At or near the top of any pitcher&#x2019;s peeves is the home-run pimp, a hitter who lingers in the batter&#x2019;s box as the ball soars over the wall. The first great player to fit this bill was Minnesota&#x2019;s Hall of Fame slugger Harmon Killebrew, by nature a quiet man who happened to take delight throughout the 1960s in watching his big flies leave the yard. &#x201c;Killebrew was the first one I saw (do it),&#x201d; said Frank Robinson. &#x201c;He would stand there and watch them. But heck, he hit the ball so high, he <i>could </i>watch them.&#x201d; Reggie Jackson, widely credited with bringing the practice to prominence in the 1970s, credits Killebrew with providing inspiration. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jackson, of course, added panache and self-absorption to the act, combined with a thirst for attention that Killebrew never knew. During Jackson&#x2019;s days with the Yankees, he went so far as to claim the final slot in batting practice because it afforded him the largest audience before which to perform. This became known as &#x201c;Reggie Time,&#x201d; and the slugger saw fit to bestow it upon some lucky teammate if he was unable to take that slot on a particular day. <br>&nbsp;<br>Barry Bonds eventually became the torchbearer for home-run pimping, not only watching but twirling in the batter&#x2019;s box as a matter of follow-through. David Halberstam wrote of Bonds&#x2019;s mid-career antics for ESPN.com: &#x201c;The pause at this moment, as we have all come to learn, is very long, plenty of time for the invisible but zen-like moment of appreciation when Barry Bonds psychically high-fives Barry Bonds and reassures him once again that there&#x2019;s no one quite like him in baseball.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Admiring one&#x2019;s own longball isn&#x2019;t all that sets pitchers off. When Phillies rookie Jimmy Rollins flipped his bat after hitting a home run off St. Louis reliever Steve Kline in 2001, the Cardinals pitcher went ballistic, screaming as he followed Rollins around the bases. &#x201c;I called him every name in the book, tried to get him to fight,&#x201d; said Kline. The pitcher stopped only upon reaching Philadelphia third baseman Scott Rolen, who was moving into the on-deck circle and alleviated the situation by assuring him that members of the Phillies would take care of it internally. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s f**king Little League s**t,&#x201d; said Kline after the game. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to flip the bat, I&#x2019;m going to flip your helmet next time. You&#x2019;re a rookie, you respect this game for a while. . . . There&#x2019;s a code. He should know better than that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography</h2><p>This best selling spiritual autobiography of Swami Muktananda tells the story of his journey to self-realization under the guidance of Bhagawan Nityananda, candidly describing his extraordinary experiences.

While it's specious to accuse Stephen Baxter and Arthur C.

It's 2035, and all four hold ringside seats at the birth of a new paradigm-destroying technology, a system of "WormCams," harnessing the power of wormholes to see absolutely anyone or anything, anywhere, at any distance (even light years away).

Perhaps you're a dog owner wannabe, reading up on your options in case your parents or landlord or spouse were to suddenly give the go-ahead. Or maybe you already have a dog and want to revel in every word devoted to her breed. Or you're the kind of dogophile that takes pleasure in everything dog-related, and a coffee-table book devoted to dogs is just the ticket to soothe your nerves after a hard day.<p> More than 400 breeds are profiled here, including far more international varieties than many a dog-breed book. Alongside the oft-seen German Shepherds and Great Danes, you'll find profiles of Pudelpointers and Groenendaels, Portuguese Watchdogs and Karabashes, Tibetan Mastiffs and Danish Chicken Dogs. And while the profiles are short--generally a half to a full page of pictures and text--each is accompanied by a series of icons that indicate important traits, such as whether or not the breed tends to be good with children, suitable for urban living, or good watchdogs, and whether it requires a lot of exercise or grooming, gets on well with other dogs, and is easy to obedience train.</p><p> "Domestic Dog Breeds," however, is but one chapter among six. The encyclopedia tracks the evolution of the dog, and does a beautiful job of explaining and illustrating the dog's body and systems, from skeleton and musculature to organs and coat variations. There's a worthwhile chapter on canine society and psychology that covers courtship and mating as well as integral concepts such as the dog pack, aggression, and affection. The encyclopedia also traces people's interest in dogs, from early domestication through folklore, film, art, and advertising to dogs in sports, in work, and as companions. And finally, there's a chapter on how to care for a dog, with advice on choosing a dog, nutrition, grooming, and behavioral problems.</p><p> In short, Fogle's encyclopedia is a fine book for dog owners to rely on and a beautiful book for soon-to-be dog owners to dream on. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Bruce Fogle, DVM is a well-known expert on animal behavior.

Steeped in Victorian atmosphere and intrigue, this diverting mystery trails a feisty heroine as she takes on a precarious secret assignment.</b><br><br>Rescued from the gallows in 1850s London, young orphan (and thief) Mary Quinn is surprised to be offered a singular education, instruction in fine manners &#x2014; and an unusual vocation. Miss Scrimshaw&#x2019;s Academy for Girls is a cover for an all-female investigative unit called The Agency, and at seventeen, Mary is about to put her training to the test. Assuming the guise of a lady&#x2019;s companion, she must infiltrate a rich merchant&#x2019;s home in hopes of tracing his missing cargo ships. But the household is full of dangerous deceptions, and there is no one to trust &#x2014; or is there? Packed with action and suspense, banter and romance, and evoking the gritty backstreets of Victorian London, this breezy mystery debuts a daring young detective who lives by her wits while uncovering secrets &#x2014; including those of her own past.</p><p>Y. S. Lee has a PhD in Victorian literature and culture and says her research inspired her to write A SPY IN THE HOUSE, &#34;a totally unrealistic, completely fictitious antidote to the fate that would otherwise swallow a girl like Mary Quinn.&#34; Y. S. Lee lives in Ontario, Canada.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Mary Quinn, a scrappy 12-year-old orphan and accomplished thief in Victorian London, is saved from the gallows by a stranger and taken to Miss Scrimshaw's Academy for Girls, an institution dedicated to turning out strong, independent, educated young women. Though reluctant at first, she accepts the challenge and eventually becomes a teacher herself. At 17, she is recruited by the mistresses of the school to join a covert group of female spies known as The Agency. Her first assignment involves posing as a lady's companion to the daughter of a man suspected of fraud and smuggling. She carries out her investigation at night and during stolen moments, but soon finds that she is not the only one on the case. Is James Easton a friend or foe? A dramatic rescue from a burning building reveals the true villain but leaves other questions unanswered. Lee fills the story with classic elements of Victorian mystery and melodrama. Class differences, love gone awry, racial discrimination, London's growing pains in the 1850s, and the status of women in society are all addressed. Historical details are woven seamlessly into the plot, and descriptive writing allows readers to be part of each scene. Readers who liked Phillip Pullman's <i>The Ruby in the Smoke</i> (Knopf, 2008) will find similar elements in this new series starter.&#x2014;<i>Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.In 1996 novelist Naylor moved to secluded St. Helena Island. A minor fracas with a crotchety neighbor, whose brother worked for the National Security Agency, set into motion a series of events that made Naylor the object of close scrutiny by the government. The intensely private Naylor found herself in the company of other prominent black writers and activists targeted by the government. She was harassed until she feared for her sanity and consulted a psychiatrist. When she discovered that her tormentors were using mind-control techniques, she fought back with the only weapon she had--her writing talent. Naylor's account, with first-person recollections of her experience and third-person speculation on the motives of her tormenters, not only raises alarms about government actions but also raises many questions about this work. She includes addenda with research and litigation regarding government experiments with mind control. Whether readers think Naylor has been the victim of pernicious abuse or that she has suffered a breakdown, her incredible book will spark debate about government surveillance and the blurring of the lines between fiction and nonfiction. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

This impossibility holds for any science concerned with the past. In addition, many manipulative experiments, while possible, would be considered immoral or illegal. One has to devise other methods of observing, describing, and explaining the world. </p><p> In the historical disciplines, a fruitful approach has been to use natural experiments or the comparative method. This book consists of eight comparative studies drawn from history, archeology, economics, economic history, geography, and political science. The studies cover a spectrum of approaches, ranging from a non-quantitative narrative style in the early chapters to quantitative statistical analyses in the later chapters. The studies range from a simple two-way comparison of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the island of Hispaniola, to comparisons of 81 Pacific islands and 233 areas of India. The societies discussed are contemporary ones, literate societies of recent centuries, and non-literate past societies. Geographically, they include the United States, Mexico, Brazil, western Europe, tropical Africa, India, Siberia, Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific islands. </p><p> In an Afterword, the editors discuss how to cope with methodological problems common to these and other natural experiments of history. </p></p><p>Jared Diamond is Professor of Geography, University of California, Los Angeles.

It is tied together not by topic or region but by the idea that we can make useful and insightful comparisons in ways that are not casual or sloppy, but actually contribute to our understanding of human life.<br> --Jeffry Frieden, Harvard University<br><br><i>Natural Experiments of History</i> is a short book packed with huge ideas. Its collected essays advocate how controlled experiments can be applied to the messy realities of human history, politics, culture, economics and the environment. It demonstrates productive interdisciplinary collaborations but also reveals gulfs between different cultures of academia...All of the essays in <i>Natural Experiments of History</i> will trigger debate.<br> --Jon Christensen (<i>Nature</i> 2010-03-25)<br><br>This ambitious, at times challenging, book aspires to contribute new ways of historical thinking and historical research by drawing attention, on the one hand, to the similarities between science (including social sciences) and history, and on the other, by using social sciences methods, especially statistical analysis, to study history. The editors argue that though the difference between studies of nature and human history is obvious, there are clear overlaps. They can be viewed through studying comparative history or by conducting "natural experiments of history" and analyzing the "perturbations" and their causes (exogenous or endogenous) in the involved cases. The book offers a broad array of case studies to illustrate and explain the argument, ranging from nonliterate to contemporary societies and from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to Brazil, India, and tropical Africa. The comparative methods showcased are quite versatile, from two-way to multiple-way comparisons. All the case studies are interesting and help demonstrate how, via comparative study, one society's, region's, or country's situation is better displayed and explained by juxtaposing it with other, similar ones.

Stunning color photographs show conifers used in a variety of environments, from small gardens to magnificent estates. </p><p> <b>Gardening with Conifers</b> reveals the unexpected magic that conifers can bring to every garden and the many roles they can play in creating structure and balance for year-round visual interest and color. Comprehensive in scope and lavishly illustrated, the book includes a directory of more than 600 conifers and offers expert advice on:</p><ul> <li>Size and growth rates</li> <li>Site and soil preferences</li> <li>Planting, maintenance and propagation</li> <li>Pruning, pests and diseases</li> <li>Dwarf conifers and ground covers</li> <li>Conifers in containers, and more.</li> </ul><p> Gardeners everywhere will find this to be a valuable and inspiring reference. </p></p><p><p> <b>Adrian Bloom</b> has 35 years of experience planting and maintaining a six-acre garden that includes 500 varieties of conifers. He designed many smaller gardens and has photographed collections in North America, Japan, New Zealand and Australia. He is an international television presenter and regularly appears on <i>The Victory Garden</i>, on WGBH Boston. </p><p> <b>Richard Bloom</b> specializes in digital studio photography. His pictures have been widely published, with dramatic, detailed close-ups his specialty. </p><p><b> The Magic of Conifers </b></p><p> 'Why should I use conifers in my garden?' is a question that anyone picking up this book might ask. The answer, I hope, will be found in the following pictures, advice and information -- conifers can add essential ingredients to a garden not easily or fully replicated by any other plants. I have spent over thirty years creating a garden with, literally, hundreds of conifers that provide interest and color the whole year round. I fully appreciate their value as well as their problems; unfortunately, it is often the latter that are highlighted by members of the gardening media who feel that conifers have little or no place in the modern garden. Gardeners in other parts of the world find it difficult to believe the paranoia that has become attached in Britain to the Leyland Cypress (x <i>Cupressocyparis leylandii</i>); this entirely innocent, fast-growing evergreen has caused costly legal disputes between neighbors simply because people plant it in the wrong places or omit to trim it. </p><p> This is not a book about Leylandii, nor is it about the negative sides of conifers, which are no more prevalent than those of any other group of plants (and will of course be covered in the text). Any fast-growing tree -- including eucalyptus, poplar or willow -- should always be chosen and placed with care. The point to make with this marvelous and varied group of mostly evergreen plants is the same as with other trees and shrubs, even perennials: consider before you buy, plan before you plant, and always take heed of growth rates and likely suitability for purpose. </p><p> Far from being dull, to the observant this group of plants can be both awe-inspiring and magical. Conifers come in all shapes and sizes -- miniatures may grow less than 3ft (90cm) in a hundred years, while others might reach 130ft (40m) or more in the same period. Conifers include the oldest living plant in the world, the ancient Bristlecone Pine, <i>Pinus longaeva</i>, whose 4,500-year-old wind-shattered specimens cling to life over 10,000ft (3,000m) up in the White Mountains of California, as well the tallest, the Coast Redwood, also in California, measuring almost 400ft (120m). If we are lucky, we can marvel at these in nature. It would not, of course, be advisable to plant a Coast Redwood in a smaller garden but, strangely enough, <i>Pinus longaeva</i> grows quite successfully at much less elevated positions, even in my garden at Bressingham in Norfolk, UK. </p><p> Conifers can be deciduous or evergreen. Among the former, the larches (<i>Larix</i>), the Swamp Cypresses (<i>Taxodium</i>) and the amazing Maidenhair Tree (<i>Ginkgo</i>) have wonderful autumn colors as their leaves turn and fall. In winter, the first two, together with the deciduous Dawn Redwood (<i>Metasequoia</i>), exhibit traceries of branches and twigs against the sky, enhanced by frost and water droplets. The evergreens can display a wonderful range of colors. It is magical to see an evergreen like <i>Pinus mugo</i> 'Wintergold' transform its green summer needles to a glowing yellow or gold in autumn -- such a cheery change can warm the heart during long winter days. </p><p> There is great interest, too, in the variety of conifer shapes -- weeping trees can take on an ethereal appearance on a misty day; frosted or snow-laden branches can sparkle in low winter sun, their burden later melting in glistening droplets. Winter, when so much else in the garden is dormant, is when conifers really come into their own. But in late spring, when the sheathed winter buds swell and burst open on spruces (<i>Picea</i>) and firs (<i>Abies</i>), smothering them in fresh new leaves, the effect is magical. That in turn can be outdone by the startling red flowers seen on many conifers as the cones begin to develop. The cones themselves can be smaller than a pea or nearly as large as a football; in their young stage, the cones of the Korean Fir (<i>Abies koreana</i>) are a rich, deep blue. </p><p> The leaves of conifers are by no means uniformly dull, green needles, as many gardeners might believe. The hues of new growth include a brilliant powder-blue, bright grass-green, orange, yellow, cream, even red and crimson. Some conifers, such as junipers, bear both prickly young and quite different coarser mature leaves at the same time; others, such as firs, spruces and pines, have bright silver-blue undersides to their leaves which are gloriously revealed when they turn to face the light. </p><p> A further wonderful asset, often overlooked, is the aromatic fragrance given by many conifers, while some junipers have quite a pungent scent. </p><p> The awe-inspiring giants of the forest -- the ancient, almost prehistoric <i>Ginkgo</i>, the <i>Metasequoia</i> and the Chilean Monkey Puzzle tree -- can all be grown today in gardens. For smaller gardens, however, a further type has added to the range -- witch's brooms. These originate as congested growths on much larger trees, and have always been associated with witchcraft. Today, collectors all over the world search forests to find interesting forms that they can propagate and offer us for our gardens.</p></p><h2>Garfield Goes Bananas: His 44th Book</h2><p><b>Stark Raving Bonkers!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Garfield is never normal, but sometimes the fat cat is more than a few sandwiches shy of a picnic&#x2014;he&#x2019;s downright daffy!

Tour.</p><p>As a foreign correspondent and writer for the <i>Washington Post,</i> Ward Just knows Washington. And what he knows he's put into his latest political novel, <i>Echo House</i>, the story of three generations of a powerful Washington family. The book's title refers to the Behl family mansion, a historic landmark that has belonged to the Behls since the Wilson administration. Constance Behl, matriarch of the family, buys the house when it seems her husband, Senator Adolph Behl, is a sure bet for the vice presidential slot on his party's ticket. The political jockeying that surrounds this nomination and Senator Behl's mortifying disappointment are dealt with in the first 20 pages, leaving the rest of the book to chronicle the fortunes of the senator's son, Axel, and grandson, Alec. <p> Axel grows up to be a wartime hero and, later, an eminent leader of the Democratic Party. He marries Sylvia, a poet, and has a son, Alec, who grows up to be a powerful beltway lawyer. Outside this family circle there is a host of minor characters--politicians and politician's wives, reporters, lawyers, generals and civil servants. But throughout <i>Echo House</i> the main character is politics itself, as men and women wheel and deal, coax and bribe and threaten their way into power.

If you listen to Jim analyze a business situation you get absolutely no baloney. And, frankly, finding someone like that is a rarity.&#x201d;<br> <br>There is only one CEO in recent times who has faced&#x2014;and succeeded at&#x2014;the extraordinary challenges of leading three major companies&#x2014;Gillette, Nabisco, and Kraft&#x2014;into prosperous futures by doing what matters on the fundamentals. <br><br>That CEO is Jim Kilts. In this vivid first-person account he reveals his system for success that is both cutting-edge and back-to-basics.<i> Doing What Matters</i>&#x2014;the action plan for identifying and tackling what&#x2019;s important and ignoring the rest&#x2014;is the key to winning in a warp-speed world where the need for revolutionary speed and decisiveness increases by the day. <br><br>Kilts illustrates his ideas with colorful stories, such as &#x201c;that little red razor.&#x201d; A new product idea he proposed early on at Gillette, it was initially shelved because &#x201c;everyone knew you couldn&#x2019;t sell a red razor,&#x201d; but went on to become one of Gillette&#x2019;s biggest marketing successes ever. <br><br>Jim Kilts&#x2019;s focus on both business fundamentals and personal attributes provides the &#x201c;complete package,&#x201d; showing how to get results that make a difference through:<br><br>� Intellectual integrity: The ability to face the unvarnished truth about yourself and your business and using what you see as the basis for action.<br><br>� Generating emotional engagement and enthusiasm: Using the force of your personality and ideas to infuse people and an entire organization with a sense of purpose and mission. <br><br>� Action: Gillette, with just five product lines, had over 20,000 SKUs. After studying the issue for over two years, there were still 20,000. How Kilts got Gillette off the dime to pare down the number to 7,000 almost overnight is an astonishing example of getting the rubber to meet the road&#x2014;with enormous benefits to the business. <br><br>� Understanding the right things through an overarching concept to frame and filter issues: For Jim Kilts it was Total Brand Value, the framework he used in the consumer products industry for achieving better, faster, and more complete results than the competition.<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re CEO of a multibillion-dollar global company, the brand manager for a product, an entrepreneur starting a small business, or just beginning a career, <i>Doing What Matters</i> provides the practical ideas that get results&#x2014;ranging from a day one action plan for starting a new job to a chorus of cheers and support to a program of total innovation that involves everyone in changes from small to &#x201c;big bang.&#x201d;</p><p>JAMES M. KILTS, a founding partner of the private equity firm Centerview Partners, previously was chairman and CEO of the Gillette Company and prior to that CEO of Nabisco and Kraft.

LORBER is president and CEO of the Lorber Kamai Consulting Group and associate professor at the University of California at Davis.Chapter 1<br><br>How Do You Know What Really Matters?<br><br>One of the first phone calls I received when news broke about my becoming Gillette&#x2019;s new CEO was from a Boston-based business associate. &#x201c;Jim, I know a lot of Gillette executives, and my advice is go slow.&#x201d; Gillette people don&#x2019;t like outsiders, he said, which is why the company last had an outside CEO seventy years ago, and he failed miserably. &#x201c;Give people time to get to know you before you start changing things,&#x201d; my friend said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the best approach you can take.&#x201d;<br><br>That call was followed by many more, along with dozens of proposals from professionals, including consultants, bankers, compensation specialists, and sales motivation experts. Each had a plan or recommendation that should receive my top priority if I wanted to succeed at Gillette.<br><br>With all that advice, how do you decide what matters? <br><br>One of the biggest impediments to success in business&#x2014;for individuals and companies&#x2014;is the failure to achieve that understanding.<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company, the brand manager for a struggling product, a director of human resources, or an entrepreneur starting your own business, you&#x2019;re always confronted with an insurmountable amount of information and a number of options, conflicting opinions, and management theories that are as endless as they are confusing.<br><br>Making these decisions isn&#x2019;t a job for the timid or weak of heart. It takes guts to say these are the things that really matter; I&#x2019;ll pay absolutely no attention to the rest. That&#x2019;s the challenge everyone faces. This book helps you meet that challenge.<br><br>You&#x2019;re always confronted with an insurmountable amount of information and possible options.<br><br>$40 Billion of LosT Value With No End In Sight<br><br>For example, I faced no bigger challenge than the decisions we made during my first months at Gillette. Early in 2001, the company had missed its earnings estimates for fifteen straight quarters. Sales and earnings had been flat for the prior four years. Market shares were declining sharply. Advertising spending, the lifeline of consumer products, had been slashed year after year. Overhead costs were high and growing. And competition was intensifying.<br><br>Wall Street had lost patience with this chronic under- performance. And Gillette&#x2019;s share price reflected the disappointment. It had fallen from an all-time high of $64.25 in March of 1999 to $24.50 in 2001. That&#x2019;s a 62 percent drop in two years&#x2014;a loss in market capitalization of close to $40 billion, and there was no end in sight.<br><br>So it&#x2019;s no surprise that analysts and investors had plenty of ideas for what had to be done. The problem was that no two suggestions were the same, and many were conflicting. It was up to me to decide which ones really mattered. Or whether it was better to put aside the advice and chart a different course.<br><br>Multiple Options, No Simple Answers<br><br>These wouldn&#x2019;t be simple decisions. And they would make the difference between whether Gillette would survive and prosper, or continue its unrelenting decline. Here are some of the suggestions that were being offered. Many would result in a corporate yard sale.<br><br>� Divest the ailing Duracell business. This was a $2 billion business that Gillette had spent around $8 billion dollars to purchase just four years before. The post-acquisition performance had been miserable. Duracell had gone from one of the best-performing brands in the consumer products sector to a true basket case. Its market share had slipped by almost 15 percent&#x2014;from 46 to 40 percent of the alkaline-battery market in the United States. And the competitive pressure was mounting. So on the face of it, selling the Duracell business and cutting any further losses seemed like a pretty good idea.<br><br>� Hold on to the Duracell business, but slash prices drastically. In other words, we should acknowledge that Gillette&#x2019;s high-priced acquisition of Duracell was a big mistake. Admit that batteries were a commodity business, not an advantaged category. And milk our investment, not try to restore it. Since it&#x2019;s never good to tilt at windmills, this was another seemingly plausible approach.<br><br>� Divest the Braun electric shaver and household appliance business. Braun represented an early acquisition by Gillette, dating back to 1967. Unfortunately, Braun&#x2019;s performance had been bleaker than Duracell&#x2019;s for a far longer time. The last time Braun had made an annual budget was such a distant memory that no present senior manager could even remember it. There was no question that Braun&#x2019;s inconsistent performance and costly investments were a major drag on Gillette.<br><br>� Divest the Personal Care business, which included such brands as Right Guard, Dry Idea, and Soft &amp; Dri antiperspirants and deodorants as well as Gillette Foamy and the Gillette Series shaving preparations. Not only were the market shares for most of these products falling, their profits also were deteriorating, with operating margins that were much lower than competitors&#x2019;.<br><br>� Strip the company by selling all assets except the highly profitable blade and razor business; operate Gillette as a pure play in one sector only. The sales would be lower, but the profit margins would be so high that the share price would rocket.<br><br>� Acknowledge that Gillette was yesterday&#x2019;s news and invent a whole new growth strategy. Enter new product sectors that analysts said were &#x201c;burgeoning with growth.&#x201d; Multiple acquisitions would redefine Gillette and jump-start the stock performance.<br><br>� Or, acknowledge that Gillette was yesterday&#x2019;s news and throw in the towel. Call in the investment bankers and work on the best possible &#x201c;endgame.&#x201d;<br><br>These were a broad and opposing group of options, and that wasn&#x2019;t all of them. There were dozens of others, dealing with everything from business and operating strategies to where Gillette&#x2019;s headquarters should be located (it was in the high-rent Prudential Tower in Boston&#x2019;s Back Bay district). I could have filled my days just sorting through the endless opinions that were being offered up on how to manage Gillette. In the end, I worked with my team to set our own course that would restore Gillette to its number one position in the consumer products arena.<br><br>Deciding What Really Matters<br><br>But how do you make such decisions? How do you know what really matters? Is there an approach that can work regardless of the circumstances? Something that can put you on the right course more often than not? There is. It&#x2019;s what I call the fast-track quick-screen elimination process. Many times in my career&#x2014;especially when working through the fog of conflicting opinions&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve found the right direction by answering a few critical questions that allow me to eliminate most, if not all, other options.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s go back to the advice on Gillette to see how it works.<br><br>Quick-screen took me to the right answer without having to slog through a swamp of details. Divest Duracell In order to divest Duracell, there had to be someone willing to buy Duracell. So Duracell had to be worth more to someone else than to Gillette. But, there wasn&#x2019;t anyone. The battery category was so irrational and competitive no company that could afford to buy Duracell wanted to get into the fray. And even if they did, Gillette&#x2019;s price-earnings ratio, which is the price investors will pay for a stock expressed as a multiple of its net earnings, was far higher than any possible buyer. So Duracell was worth more to Gillette than anyone else. By utilizing the fast-track quick-screen elimination process, I could eliminate the &#x201c;sell Duracell&#x201d; option. No need to give it a second thought.<br><br>Milk Duracell A second option was slash the prices on Duracell, admit it&#x2019;s an undifferentiated commodity, and milk the business. This time I applied my past experience in the quick-screen process. Was a Duracell battery more or less of a commodity than Kraft Singles&#x2014;the cheese slices that carried, on average, a 25 percent higher price than private-label products when I managed the Kraft business? (Literally, in blind taste tests, consumers could detect only a slight difference between Kraft and private-label.)<br><br>The differences between Duracell batteries and the private-label and price-brand batteries were perceived by consumers to be significant on a number of factors, including reliability and durability. In addition, the performance difference between alkaline Duracell and general-purpose zinc batteries was enormous. So why give up on Duracell, a branded product with great equity and an impeccable twenty-year record of high growth and profitability, simply because it had stumbled for the last three years? Again, the quick screen took us to the right answer without having to slog through a swamp of detail. (Don&#x2019;t get me wrong; we later did an exhaustive study of the battery business. Our new management team had to assess the category&#x2019;s potential and determine the best way to get it. And that required detailed analysis.)<br><br>The quick screen told us that Duracell was the leader in the alkaline battery category, which meant it should be disciplined in how it led the category and in how it imposed discipline when the nonleaders got out of line. Duracell had done neither.<br><br>The leader in a consumer products category must invest in marketing to drive growth and increase the consumer equity and preference for the brand. Instead, Duracell had cut its advertising substantially.<br><br>A category leader must demonstrate that it won&#x2019;t allow competitors to steal its market share. Duracell allowed repeated theft of market share by relatively minor competitors that emboldened them for future initiatives. Category leaders must avoid creating a frenzy of out-of-control ...</p><h2>Voices of Wisdom Hawaiian Elders Speak</h2><p>It is a rare privilege to sit at the feet of Hawaii&#39;s elders--to hear their stories firsthand. Such wisdom and knowledge are seldom passed beyond Hawaiian communities, but now, with this book, their expertise is available to us all. Described by &#34;The Maui News&#34; as &#34;a brilliant book of interviews with amazing photographs,&#34; Voices ofWisdom is a book that explains Hawaiian culture through the lives of 24 Hawaiians, each an expert in some facet of Hawaiiana. It is not just the stories and personalities of these 24 that are featured--through each individual we learn about a discipline, talent or skill valued in Hawaiian culture. These 24 are leaders of the cultural renaissance that awakened the Hawaiian spirit in recent decades. These are people who have led lives that matter, and what matters most to them is to keep lit the flame of a culture that nearly died. Through their efforts, Hawaiian culture will live on into the next century.</p><p>Hawaiian tradition honors the elders as keepers of its knowledge and wisdom. The 24 people interviewed in Voices of Wisdom continue that tradition by teaching us their mastery. They are kahuna, in the old days considered the best in their specialty. Here are a few excerpts of their voices: "We somewhat live yesterday in combination with today." <p>Jo-Anne Sterling "Our goal was to recapture our traditions, to make our people feel proud of those traditions and therefore proud about themselves." </p><p>Nainoa Thompson "The gift of mana [power, spiritual essence] is all of ours, and we can command this mana. You generate mana through prayer, through deep breathing and through meditation." </p><p>Lanakila Brandt "It's said that Hawaiian massage is praying work." </p><p>Margaret Machado "The hula is Hawai'i. The hula is the history of our country. The hula is a story itself if it's done right. And the hula, to me, is the foundation of life. It teaches us how to live, how to respect, how to share. The hula, to me, is the ability to create one's inner feelings and no one else's." </p><p>George Na'ope "The work [kapa making] was done almost exclusively by the women and that intrigues me. I want the world to know what that Hawaiian woman did and what she went through to produce the ultimate art piece in the fiber arts.

Over the next two hundred years, its stimulating properties seduced all of British society, as tea found its way into cottages and castles alike. One of the first truly global commodities and now the world&#x2019;s most popular drink, tea has also, today, come to epitomize British culture and identity.<br><br> This impressively detailed book offers a rich cultural history of tea, from its ancient origins in China to its spread around the world.

They look at European scientists&#x2019; struggles to understand tea&#x2019;s history and medicinal properties, and they recount the ways its delicate flavor and exotic preparation have enchanted poets and artists. Exploring everything from its everyday use in social settings to the political and economic controversies it has stirred&#x2014;such as the Boston Tea Party and the First Opium War&#x2014;they offer a multilayered look at what was ultimately an imperial industry, a collusion&#x2014;and often clash&#x2014;between the world&#x2019;s greatest powers over control of a simple beverage that has become an enduring pastime.</p><p><b>Markman Ellis</b> is professor of eighteenth-century studies at Queen Mary, University of London. <b>Richard Coulton</b> is a lecturer in the Department of English at Queen Mary, University of London. <b>Matthew Mauger</b> is a lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London.&#x201c;<i>Empire of Tea</i> is a wonderfully wide-ranging and illuminating study of tea (the commodity, the drink, its rituals, its associations) that combines a long-term history of its changing place in the national, imperial, and global economy with fascinating insights into how it became embedded in British culture.

His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</p><p>Part melodrama and part parable, Mitch Albom's <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> weaves together three stories, all told about the same man: 83-year-old Eddie, the head maintenance person at Ruby Point Amusement Park. As the novel opens, readers are told that Eddie, unsuspecting, is only minutes away from death as he goes about his typical business at the park. Albom then traces Eddie's world through his tragic final moments, his funeral, and the ensuing days as friends clean out his apartment and adjust to life without him. In alternating sections, Albom flashes back to Eddie's birthdays, telling his life story as a kind of progress report over candles and cake each year. And in the third and last thread of the novel, Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la <i>A Christmas Carol</i>). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs. <p> Albom takes a big risk with the novel; such a story can easily veer into the saccharine and preachy, and this one does in moments. But, for the most part, Albom's telling remains poignant and is occasionally profound. Even with its flaws, <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i> is a small, pure, and simple book that will find good company on a shelf next to <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Mitch Albom is the author of nine books. His first novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven , is the most successful U.S. hardback first novel ever and has to date sold over 8 million copies worldwide. Tuesdays With Morrie, (1997) his chronicle of time spent with a beloved but dying college professor, spent four years on the New York Times bestseller list and is now the most successful memoir ever published. Both books were eventually turned into celebrated TV films. The critically acclaimed Five People You Meet in Heaven aired on ABC in winter, 2004. Oprah Winfrey produced the film version of Tuesdays With Morrie in December 1999; starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria. The film garnered four Emmy awards, including best TV film, director, actor and supporting actor. An award-winning journalist and radio host, Albom wrote the screenplay for The Five People You Meet in Heaven, and is an established playwright, having authored numerous pieces for the theater, including the off-Broadway version of Tuesdays With Morrie (co-written with Jeffrey Hatcher) which has seen more than 40 productions nationwide, and several recent comedies which have been produced and performed in venues across the country. Albom has founded three charities in the metropolitan Detroit area: "The Dream Fund," established in 1989, allows disadvantaged children to become involved with the arts. "A Time To Help," founded in 1998, brings volunteers together once a month to tackle various projects in Detroit, including staffing shelters, building homes with Habitat for Humanity, and operating meals on wheels programs for the elderly. &#x201c;S.A.Y Detroit,&#x201d; Albom&#x2019;s most recent effort, is an umbrella program to fund shelters and care for the homeless in his city. He also raises money for literacy projects through a variety of means including his performances with The Rock Bottom Remainders, a band made up of writers which includes Steven King, Dave Barry, Scott Turrow, Amy Tan and Ridley Pearson. Albom serves on the boards of various charities and, in 1999, was named National Hospice Organization's Man of the Year.</p><h2>Simply Scandinavian</h2><p>Scandinavian interior design is admired the world over for its<p></p><p>unpretentious simplicity and understated elegance.

This lavishly illustrated work walks readers through Mustang&#x2019;s forty-plus years of continuous production a rich and varied history nearly unmatched in the automotive world. &nbsp; From the first six-cylindered &#x2019;Stang of 1964 1/2 through today&#x2019;s fire-breathing, world-beating Mustang, The Complete Book of Mustang offers an in-depth look at the prototypes and experimental models, the anniversary and pace cars, and the specialty packages for street and competition driving that have made the Mustang an automotive legend for nearly a half century. With extensive details, specs, and photographic coverage, this book is the ultimate resource on America&#x2019;s best-loved pony car. Now updated to include all models through 2011.</p><p><p>On Friday, April 17, 1964, Dearborn officials introduced America to an entirely new breed of automobile, a fun machine that brought buyers galloping into their friendly neighborhood Ford dealerships. Demand instantly overwhelmed supply, with the few available showroom teaser cars claimed even before they were unveiled. Of course, the initial hubbub eventually died down, though Mustang sales remained incredibly strong for years to come. The one-millionth Mustang rolled off the line in February 1966, and nearly 300,000 pony cars were still hitting the streets annually in 1968.</p> <p>A resurgence came in 1979 as the more comfortable Fox-chassis Mustang debuted. Performance and pizzazz quickly rose, evidenced by the return of the GT in 1982 and a convertible rendition in 1983, following hiatuses of 13 and 10 years, respectively. A legacy within a legacy grew as the 5.0-liter HO V-8 gained strength to become one of Detroit&#x2019;s best performance buys. Two years later, it was replaced by the thoroughly modern 4.6-liter modular V-8 with its overhead-cam layout. An even hotter version of this engine, fitted with dual overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, was created for the Special Vehicle Team&#x2019;s (SVT) Cobra Mustang, which debuted in 1993. Thus armed, the SVT Cobra surpassed 300 horsepower in 1996 and was on the verge of topping 400 horses in 2003, when the Special Vehicle Team marked its 10-year anniversary.</p> <p>That same year was Ford Motor Company&#x2019;s 100th, and the Mustang&#x2019;s own 40th birthday followed in 2004. Fortunately, those little 40th-anniversary badges weren&#x2019;t the only presents unwrapped by Ford party-goers during the celebration. Unveiling the 2005 Mustang that January was the real icing on the cake, and there is no doubt the legacy will continue rolling on toward the next milestone.</p> <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>This is a Mustang book like no other Mustang book</b>. With incredible attention to detail and historical accuracy, this mammoth book includes descriptions of every single Mustang production variant, prototype, and factory race car.

Time-stamped late April, the rains must have exposed her. Or maybe the rain-swollen river rose around her, the current rinsing away the foot or so of silt that had covered her. Time-stamped 6:44 p.m.&#x2014; shafts of sunlight slant through the woods, dappling the mud in the clearings. The water&#x2019;s a mossy green where the sunlight hits, but outside the direct sunlight the water&#x2019;s a sooty brown, almost black. I think of the earth here, the history of this place, how accustomed it is to burning&#x2014;the hillsides running steep to the riverbed were once slag heaps for the mills, rolling landslides of molten ash&#x2014;but by the time I knew this place, everything was reclaimed and greened. It was a city park.</p><p>When the time stamp&#x2019;s reached 7:31 p.m. it&#x2019;s grown too dark to see so I adjust the light filters. The woods and the body brighten with the sickly pallor of digitized light. I can see her feet now, white like white mushrooms grown bulbous in the soil. Bookmark the body. I leave her, finding my way back through the woods along the jogging path in the utter dark.</p><p>At the trailhead parking lot I reset to 6:15 p.m., a half hour before I will find her body. The night reverses to a bluer shade of dusk. I follow the jogging path that runs serpentine through the woods before scaling down a tangle of roots and bramble, holding on to reedy branches to keep my balance. I&#x2019;ve been this way before. Scan the underbrush for footprints or signs of struggle, scraps of clothing, anything, but I don&#x2019;t find any tangible traces until I find the white lump of her body&#x2014;a pallid curve I take as her back and a spray of hair much darker from mud than the honey-brown I know from photographs of her. I kneel near her. I study her, trying to piece together what happened&#x2014;trying to understand. At 7:31 p.m. it&#x2019;s grown too dark to see.</p><p>I retrace my steps. At the trailhead parking lot, I reset to 6:15 p.m. and the night reverses. Her body&#x2019;s down there, half buried in mud. I start along the jogging path, scanning the woods for traces of her. I&#x2019;ll find her in about twenty minutes.<br></p><p><br><br>10, 21&#x2014;</p><p><br>People often ask us how their loved ones died, expecting extra-ordinary circumstances or wondering whether they suffered terribly, and I&#x2019;m reminded of Auden&#x2019;s &#x201c;Mus�e des Beaux Arts&#x201d; because, with rare exception, the deaths we research are banal&#x2014; someone eating, opening a window or walking dully along. Nothing extraordinary&#x2014;though often survivors remember how fine a day it was, how perfect for autumn, how almost like summer. The end occurred quickly, that much is verifiable&#x2014;no one suffered except the ones who lived. Five hundred thousand lives ended in the blinding white flash. Shadows elongated and became like charcoal smudges, the City became like snowy ash and in a breath of wind vanished. Other than details, all we really answer about their loved ones is that they likely did not suffer and they likely died as they had lived. Even this dreadful martyrdom ran its course.</p><p>October twenty-first&#x2014; </p><p>Ten years since the end.</p><p>Tuesday&#x2019;s the last I used brown sugar. I&#x2019;d even pinged Kucenic that morning to be courteous, to tell him I&#x2019;d a touch of the bug and wouldn&#x2019;t be coming in&#x2014;but he informed me I&#x2019;m already out of sick days and vacation days and some of the other archival assistants were tired of covering for me. That I would be docked pay and may face probation. There&#x2019;d been complaints, he said. He voiced a few minutes later, his profile pic all snowy beard and kind blue eyes, his Adware left gaudily exposed like a crosshatch of silver wires threading his skull beneath his wispy hair. This was over at Tryst Coffeehouse, on their Wi-Fi to take the call. My Adware&#x2019;s shoddy, running a skittish frame rate that augments reality with a shitty split-second delay. Kucenic&#x2019;s image hung in my eyes like a transparency overlaying caf� menus, displays of lattes, Red Eyes, mochas, velvety coffees hovering wherever I looked, Fair Trade and Organic info scrolling over every bag of beans. He asked if everything was all right, but his lips weren&#x2019;t quite synched up with his words.</p><p>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;My sinuses, I think, just a sinus infection&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re researching homicide,&#x201d; he told me. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be better tomorrow&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve trusted you with potential fraud and homicide,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a schedule we have to follow, there are reports&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her body was tampered with&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Self-conscious discussing the body in a crowded caf�, but everyone at the nearby tables was immersed in their own Adware streams, chatting to unseen companions or slumped over their coffee lost in private fantasies&#x2014;no one paying attention to me.</p><p>&#x201c;RFI #14502&#x2014;Hannah Massey,&#x201d; said Kucenic. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve written that the Archive&#x2019;s corrupted around her&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoever&#x2019;s trying to cover up the killing is sloppy,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;All those corruptions in the Archive are like fingerprints, but there are a million fingerprints and it will take time to make sense of them all&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re burning yourself out,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I understand this is a difficult time for you, and I&#x2019;m sympathetic, I am, but I need to know if you can handle this report right now. It&#x2019;s been months since you first found her. I need you to wrap this up. Do you need help? We can work out a leave of absence. We can reassign your cases&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a leave,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t afford a leave&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What does your doctor say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave personal shit out of this,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t turn this personal&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing taxing work,&#x201d; he said, easing off a bit. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always thorough in your approach, but there are gaps in your presentation. Significant gaps. What about the victim&#x2019;s parents? Her friends? You haven&#x2019;t even filled in her last hours&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are no last hours, not yet,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tracked her to the point of her disappearance, but that&#x2019;s not when she died. She was on campus, a psychology lecture about human-computer interaction. After class she cut through campus and entered the lower level of a parking garage on Fifth Avenue, near Morewood. No security cameras down there. That&#x2019;s when she was taken&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I minimized Kucenic and stared into my coffee, at the nutrition facts appearing there like legible shimmers of light. There&#x2019;s a gap in the Archive from when she entered the parking garage to when I found her body near the river. Security cameras were installed in that garage in the weeks after she vanished&#x2014;there&#x2019;s plenty of footage of the garage&#x2019;s lower levels time-stamped weeks and months following her disappearance, of security guards making their rounds on golf carts, but all too late.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to trim the scope of what you&#x2019;re working on. State Farm just wants proof of how she died,&#x201d; said Kucenic. &#x201c;A documented cause of death&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all. A one-page summary. And when we&#x2019;re certain we&#x2019;re dealing with homicide, I&#x2019;ll have to register her death with the FBI&#x2014;there are legal implications if we don&#x2019;t handle this properly. We need to stick to their timetables. I can&#x2019;t go days or weeks without hearing from you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I found her body,&#x201d; I told him, thinking of spring rains sluicing away her shallow burial. &#x201c;No one else would have&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Dominic,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re going to work in this field, you have to understand the bigger picture. You can&#x2019;t just hole up in the research, block out every other consideration. You have to understand that when I meet with State Farm, their reps will be excited by what you&#x2019;ve found, the work you&#x2019;re doing, but their first question will be Why haven&#x2019;t you told us how she died? That information means money to them&#x2014;they care about the money, not the girl. You have to think like they think if you want to be effective in this line of work&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t care who killed her, just that she was killed,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that right? You want me to ignore what happened to her? I can&#x2019;t do that, Kucenic. For the past few weeks, whenever I close my eyes I see her&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All these images aren&#x2019;t real,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;You immerse into the Archive and if you&#x2019;re not careful, you forget that it isn&#x2019;t real. You spend so much time watching people die, it can affect you. It&#x2019;s okay if you can&#x2019;t keep up right now, if you can&#x2019;t work like this&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;forget that it isn&#x2019;t real?&#x2019; It was all real&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Log some hours,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Work through this. I&#x2019;ll need an update by this afternoon&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, fine,&#x201d; I told him, but skipped work that afternoon anyway. I immersed at the Mount. Pleasant Library, accessing their public Wi-Fi from a wingback chair in the gov docs room that&#x2019;s hidden from the reference desk librarians. Private back there, no one to bother me. Brown sugar comes in blister packs&#x2014;taupe heptagons&#x2014;cut for use as a study aid. I dry swallowed the pill. I closed my eyes when the sweetness hit and my breaths grew deeper. I loaded the City. I was with my wife then. For a solid ten hours, at least, I was with her. The librarians kicked me out at closing so I slept the night in their parking lot, half hidden by a hedgerow. Still connected when I woke, but the City had timed out&#x2014;the morning feeds blaring Cash Amateurs and looped promos for season 4 of Chance in Hell and the Voyeur Cam pay streams and Real Swingers of DC and groupons if I opinioned who was hotter between last week&#x2019;s murdered Fur girls on Crime Scene Superstar, blonde versus redhead, dead teen bodies displayed in crime scene streams, Look here to vote, look here&#x2014;<br>Dr. Simka has diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, substance abuse disorder and secondary traumatization. He&#x2019;s prescribed Zoloft and suggests I should exercise more, that jogging through Rock Creek Park when the weather&#x2019;s nicer or training for the National Half Marathon will cleanse toxins from my bloodstream. He says I&#x2019;m putting on weight and it worries him.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we should try to lose some weight together,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve told him, but he just pats his belly and laughs.</p><p>Simka&#x2019;s offices are over in Kalorama, near 21st and Florida, in the building with the bright red door. He&#x2019;s filled his waiting room with furniture that he&#x2019;s made&#x2014;black cherry Mission-style chairs, a magazine table, a matching bookshelf filled with his early editions of Lacan. After our biweekly hour I feel I&#x2019;ve pawned damaged goods to him, that my case is certain to hurt his success rate. I mention this to him while he&#x2019;s signing my EAP paperwork, but he just smiles and nods and strokes his bushy mustache and says, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need style points to win&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ve learned to trust Dr. Simka. I talk with him about Theresa, about my memories. We discuss the amount of time I spend in the Pittsburgh Archive visiting her. We try to set limits, boundaries&#x2014; we try to set goals. Simka doesn&#x2019;t believe in VR therapy, preferring face-to-face contact with his patients, so I relax on his cushy leather couch and have conversations with him&#x2014;about anything, anything at all, whatever&#x2019;s on my mind, whatever thoughts I&#x2019;m trying to exorcise. I talk with him about my work for Kucenic, about the archival research I&#x2019;m assigned&#x2014;the information&#x2019;s confidential, but I unburden myself to Simka. I told him about RFI 14502, the woman whose body I found.</p><p>&#x201c;There was a dispute,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;The policyholder&#x2019;s beneficiary&#x2014;her sister, in Akron&#x2014;filed life insurance claims for the woman and her three children, but State Farm contested the claims to avoid part of the payout, contending that only two of the woman&#x2019;s children could be verified as dying as a direct result of the bomb&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, your firm was contacted to confirm their deaths,&#x201d; said Simka.</p><p>&#x201c;Kucenic won the case in a batch bid and assigned it as part of my caseload,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;We were contracted to find evidence to bolster State Farm&#x2019;s dispute, or if we found that all three children did die in the blast, to provide recommendations for a settlement&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Either way, you&#x2019;re searching for a dead child,&#x201d; said Simka.</p><p>&#x201c;I found the first death easily enough,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;A boy at Harrison Middle School. Plenty of security cameras in the school, plenty of footage to reconstruct his life. I made sure I was with him in the classroom as he died, marking when the white light streamed through the windows, marking when he burned. The second child was only a few months old. Another boy. I logged several hours in the house with the policyholder, the mother. She spent almost every afternoon watching The Price Is Right while her boy cried in the bassinet. Sometimes I picked up the boy to try and soothe him, I don&#x2019;t know why&#x2014;I knew it didn&#x2019;t matter, that the boy was long since dead, that the crying was just a webcam recording re-created there. I just held him, sang to him until he calmed, but the moment I put him down the Archive reset and he was back in his bassinet crying. He was crying in his crib when he died. Each child earned a separate report&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the third?&#x201d; asked Simka.</p><p>&#x201c;Hannah,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Nineteen years old. She&#x2019;d been tampered with in the Archive, huge chunks of her life deleted. State Farm keyed in on the deletions when their researchers first examined the claim, which is why they put it up for bid, but they couldn&#x2019;t track her&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you could?&#x201d; asked Simka.</p><p>&#x201c;I can be obsessive about the research, is all,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;State Farm doesn&#x2019;t have the manpower. When something&#x2019;s been deleted from the Archive, it generates an exception report because the code falters. If you isolate time frames you can print thousands of pages of exception reports and slog through them, try to stitch back what&#x2019;s happened. Clever hacks replace whatever they&#x2019;ve deleted or changed in the Archive with something else, something similar&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re careful, you can delete something and insert a forgery without generating an error message at all. Whoever deleted Hannah, though, wasn&#x2019;t skilled or very careful&#x2014;I could reconstruct her life by following the exception messages, reading the code; it just took time. I imagine it&#x2019;s like following a boar after it crashes through the underbrush&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you find her?&#x201d; asked Simka.</p><p>&#x201c;I found her body in the river, half buried in mud over in this reclaimed slag site called Nine Mile Run. Academic footage of the watershed taken by Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s Environmental Science department. Her body had been buried there, but the rain washed away the mud that had covered her. Whoever deleted her didn&#x2019;t think to delete JSTOR footage or didn&#x2019;t know it existed as part of the Archive. By the time I found her body, she was swollen. Hard to even recognize&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You seem particularly upset over her death. You deal with this type of work on a regular basis&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You would have liked her,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;She was a psych major. An actress in a comedy troupe called Scotch &#x2019;n&#x2019; Soda. She was a head turner, vibrant&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t even recognize her body when I found her in that footage. Only a few minutes of white in the mud, a partial of her back and her feet. I had to prove it was her through the exception reports&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Nearly every death is contested, nearly every property damage claim. Billions and billions of dollars in lawsuits.

Tour.</p><p>Smith uses the Old and New Testaments as a wellspring for a creative cookbook of more than 100 recipes based on, for the most part, ingredients used in biblical times. Of course, as an ordained Methodist minister, he seizes on the opportunity to explain the use of food allegories and symbolism in the Bible and to bemoan contemporary Americans' lack of communal feasts and their reliance on packaged foods. That gentle sermon sparks his tenth culinary collection, centered on grains, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products and highlighted by only a handful of meat and poultry items. Although few dishes are truly new, many are appearing for the first time in a mass-market cookbook. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Terror at Beslan: A Russian Tragedy with Lessons for America&#39;s Schools</h2><p>This is the Revised 2012 Edition.

The Turks soon proceeded to indulge in an orgy of pillage, rape and slaughter that the Western powers anxious to protect their oil and trade interests in Turkey, condoned by their silence and refusal to intervene. Turkish forces then set fire to the legendary city and totally destroyed it. There followed a massive cover-up by tacit agreement of the Western Allies who had defeated Turkey and Germany during World War I.

Even though I have lived all my life in Sk&#x152;ne, where fog is forever closing in and shutting out the world, I&#x2019;ll never get used to it.<br><br>9 p.m., October 11, 1993.<br><br>Fog came rolling in from the sea. He was driving home to Ystad and had just passed Br?sarp Hills when he found himself in the thick of the white mass.<br><br>Fear overcame him right away.<br><br>I&#x2019;m frightened of fog, he thought. I should be scared of the man I have just been to see at Farnholm Castle instead. The friendly man whose menacing staff always lurk in the background, their faces in the shadows. I should be thinking about him and what I now know is hidden behind that friendly smile. His impeccable standing in the community, above the very least suspicion. He is the one I should be frightened of, not the fog drifting in from Han? Bay. Not now that I have discovered that he would not hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way.<br><br>He turned on the wipers to try to clear the windshield. He did not like driving in the dark. He particularly disliked it when rabbits scurried this way and that in the headlights.<br><br>Once, more than thirty years ago, he had run over a hare. It was on the Tomelilla road, one evening in early spring. He could still remember stamping his foot down on the brake pedal, but then a dull thud against the bodywork. He had stopped and got out. The hare was lying on the road, its back legs kicking. The upper part of its body was paralyzed, but its eyes stared at him. He had had to force himself to find a heavy stone from the verge, and had shut his eyes as he threw it down onto the hare&#x2019;s head. He had hurried back to the car without looking again at the animal.<br><br>He had never forgotten those eyes and those wildly kicking legs. The memory kept coming back, again and again, usually at the most unexpected times.<br><br>He tried now to put the unpleasantness behind him. A hare that died all of thirty years ago can haunt a man, but it can&#x2019;t harm him, he thought. I have more than enough worries about people still in the land of the living.<br><br>He noticed that he was checking his rearview mirror more often than usual.<br><br>I&#x2019;m frightened, he thought again, and I have only just realized that I am running away. I am running from what I know is hidden behind the walls of Farnholm Castle. And they know that I know. But how much? Enough for them to be afraid that I&#x2019;ll break the oath of silence I once took as a newly qualified lawyer? A long time ago that was, when an oath was just that: a sacred commitment to professional secrecy. Are they nervous about their old lawyer&#x2019;s conscience?<br>Nothing in the rearview mirror. He was alone in the fog, but in under an hour he would be back in Ystad.<br><br>The thought cheered him, if only for a moment. So they weren&#x2019;t following him after all. He had made up his mind what he was going to do tomorrow. He would talk to his son, who was also his colleague and a partner in the legal practice. There was always a solution, that was something life had taught him. There had to be one this time too.<br><br>He groped on the unlit dashboard for the radio. The car filled with a man&#x2019;s voice talking about the latest research in genetics. Words passed through his brain without his taking them in. He checked his watch: nearly 9:30. Still no one behind him, but the fog seemed to be getting even thicker. Nevertheless, he pressed down on the accelerator a little harder. The further he was from Farnholm Castle, the calmer he felt. Perhaps, after all, he had nothing to fear.<br><br>He forced himself to think clearly.<br><br>It had begun with a perfectly ordinary telephone call, a message on his desk asking him to contact a man about a contract that urgently needed verifying. He did not recognize the name, but had taken the initiative and made the call: a small law practice in an insignificant Swedish town could not afford to reject a potential client. He could recall even now the voice on the phone: polite, with a northern accent, but at the same time giving the impression of a man who measured out his life in terms of what each minute cost. He had explained the task, a complicated transaction involving a shipping line registered in Corsica and a number of cement cargoes to Saudi Arabia, where one of his companies was acting as an agent for Skanska. There had been some vague, passing reference to an enormous mosque that was to be built in Khamis Mushayt. Or maybe it was a university building in Jeddah.<br><br>They had met a few days later at the Continental Hotel in Ystad. He had arrived there early, and the restaurant was not yet open for lunch; he had sat at a table in the corner and watched the man arrive. The only other person there was a Yugoslav waiter staring gloomily out of the window. It was the middle of January, a gale was blowing in from the Baltic, and it would soon be snowing. But the man approaching him was suntanned. He wore a dark blue suit and was definitely no more than fifty. Somehow, he did not belong either in Ystad or in the January weather. He was a stranger, with a smile that did not belong to that suntanned face.<br><br>That was the first time he had set eyes on the man from Farnholm Castle. A man without baggage, in a discrete world of his own, in a blue, tailor-made suit, everything centering on a smile, and an alarming pair of shadowy satellites buzzing attentively but in the background.<br><br>Oh yes, the shadows had been there even then. He could not recall either of them being introduced. They sat at a table on the other side of the room, and rose without a word when their master&#x2019;s meeting was over. <br><br>Golden days, he thought, bitterly, and I was stupid enough to believe in it. A lawyer&#x2019;s vision of the world should not be influenced by the illusion of a paradise to come, not here on earth at least. Within six months the suntanned man had come to be responsible for half of the practice&#x2019;s turnover, and in a year the firm&#x2019;s income had doubled. Bills were paid promptly, it was never necessary to send a reminder. They had been able to afford to redecorate their offices. The man at Farnholm Castle seemed to be managing his business in every corner of the world, and from places that seemed to be chosen more or less at random. Faxes and telephone calls, even the occasional radio transmission, came from the strangest-sounding towns, some he could only with difficulty find on the globe next to the leather sofa in the reception area. But everything had been aboveboard, albeit complex.<br><br>The new age has dawned, he remembered thinking. So this is what it&#x2019;s like. As a lawyer, I have to be grateful that the man at Farnholm picked my name from the telephone book.<br><br>His train of recollections was cut short. For a moment he thought he was imagining it, but then he clearly made out the headlights in the rearview mirror.<br><br>They had crept up on him.<br><br>Fear struck him immediately. They had followed him after all. They were afraid he would betray his oath of silence.<br><br>His first reaction was to accelerate away through the fog. Sweat broke out on his forehead. The headlights were on his tail. Shadows that kill, he thought. I&#x2019;ll never get away, just as none of the others did.<br><br>The car passed him. He caught a glimpse of the driver&#x2019;s face, an old man. Then the red taillights vanished into the fog.<br><br>He took out a handkerchief and wiped his face and neck.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll soon be home, he thought. Nothing is going to happen. Mrs Dun?r has recorded in my diary that I was to be at Farnholm today. Nobody, not even he, would send his henchmen to kill off his own elderly lawyer on the way home from a meeting. It would be far too risky.<br><br>It was nearly two years before he first realized that something untoward was going on. It was an insignificant assignment, checking contracts that involved the Swedish Trade Council as guarantors for a considerable sum of money. Spare parts for turbines in Poland, combine harvesters for Czechoslovakia. It was a minor detail, some figures that didn&#x2019;t add up. He thought it was probably a misprint, maybe somewhere two digits had been muddled. He had gone through it all again and realized that it was no accident, it was all intentional. Nothing was missing, everything was correct, but the upshot was horrifying. His first instinct had been not to believe it. He had leaned back in his chair&#x2013;it was late in the evening, he recalled&#x2013;taking in that there was no doubt that he had uncovered a crime. It was dawn before he had set out to walk the streets of Ystad, and by the time he reached Stortorget he had reluctantly accepted that there was no alternative explanation: the man at Farnholm Castle was guilty of a gross breach of trust regarding the Trade Council, of tax evasion, and of a whole string of forgeries.<br><br>After that he had constantly been on the lookout for the black holes in every document emanating from Farnholm. And he found them&#x2013;not every time, but more often than not. The extent of the criminality had slowly dawned on him. He tried not to acknowledge the evidence he could not avoid registering, but in the end he had to face up to the facts. But on the other hand he had done nothing about it. He had not even told his son. Was this because, deep down, he preferred to believe it wasn&#x2019;t true? Nobody else, apparently not even the tax authorities, had noticed anything. Perhaps he had uncovered a secret that was purely hypothetical? Or was it that it was all too late anyway, now that the man from Farnholm Castle was the principal source of income for the firm?<br><br>The fog was more or less impenetrable now. He hoped it might lift as he got nearer to Ystad.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t go on like this, that was certain. Not now that he knew that the man had blood on his hands.<br><br>He would talk to his son. The rule of law still applied in Sweden, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, even though it seemed to be undermined and diluted day by day. His own complaisance had been a part of that process. His having turned a blind eye for so long was no reason for remaining silent now.<br><br>He would never bring himself to commit suicide.<br><br>Suddenly he saw something in the headlights. He slammed on the brakes. At first he thought it was a hare. Then he realized there was something in the road.<br><br>He turned on his brights.<br><br>It was a chair, in the middle of the road. A simple kitchen chair. Sitting on it was a human-sized effigy. Its face was white.<br><br>Or could it be a real person made up like a tailor&#x2019;s dummy?<br><br>He felt his heart starting to pound. Fog swirled in the light of his headlamps. There was no way he could shut out the chair and the effigy. Nor could he ignore his mounting fear. He checked his rearview mirror. Nothing. He drove slowly forward until the chair and the effigy were no more than ten meters from the car. Then he stopped again.<br>The dummy looked impressively like a human being. Not just some kind of hastily put-together scarecrow. It&#x2019;s for me, he thought. He switched off the radio, his hand trembling, and pricked up his ears. Fog, and silence. He didn&#x2019;t know what to do next.<br><br>What made him hesitate was not the chair out there in the fog, nor the ghostly effigy. There was something else, something in the background, something he couldn&#x2019;t make out. Something that probably existed only inside himself.<br><br>I&#x2019;m very frightened, he said to himself, and fear is undermining my ability to think straight.<br><br>Finally, he undid his seat belt and opened the door. He was surprised by how cool it felt outside. He got out, his eyes fixed on the chair and the dummy lit up by the car&#x2019;s headlights. His last thought was that it reminded him of a stage set with an actor about to make his entrance.<br><br>He heard a noise behind him, but he didn&#x2019;t turn. The blow caught him on the back of his head.<br><br>He was dead before his body hit the damp asphalt.<br><br>It was 9:53 p.m. The fog was now very dense.</p><h2>Hidden Ohio Map and Guide, 3rd edition</h2><p>This newly updated 3rd edition is your guide to hidden, unusual and unique features across the Buckeye State!

Meanwhile, a horticulturist, heir to the Great Migration that brought masses of African Americans to Detroit, and her husband, a product of the white flight from it, have turned to urban farming to revitalize the blighted city they both love. And near Missoula, Montana, a couple who have been at the forefront of organic farming for decades navigate what it means to live and raise a family ethically.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>A work of immersive journalism steeped in a distinctively American social history and sparked by a personal quest, <i>The Unsettlers</i> traces the search for the simple life through the stories of these new pioneers and what inspired each of them to look for -- or create -- a better existence. Captivating and clear-eyed, it dares us to imagine what a sustainable, ethical, authentic future might actually look like.</p><p><p><b>Mark Sundeen&nbsp;</b>is the author of several books, including <i>The Man Who Quit Money </i>and the coauthor of <i>North by Northwestern</i>, which was a <i>New York Times </i>and <i>Wall Street Journal </i>bestseller.

He and his wife divide their time between Fort Collins, Colorado, and Moab, Utah.</p>One<br><br>I was looking for people freed from commercial civilization, who might give me direction for doing it myself. Yet after a full year, everyone I'd met fell into one of five categories, none of which was exactly right.<br><br>First were single men. These guys had achieved self-reliance, but in cutting ties with the economy, they had also severed family bonds, the opposite of what I was on the verge of doing. I wanted blueprints for cohabitation, not hermitry.<br><br>Next I met people who, after leading a simple life for some period of time, decided to quit&#x2014;Cedar's parents, for example. After years of eking out a living growing food and selling stained glass at craft fairs, they both got full-time jobs and eventually replaced the barn with a beautiful on-grid home. "We took poverty as far as we could," her dad told me with a laugh. A friend of mine who birthed a baby in a school bus in a snowstorm on a mountain told me that tripping in the snow on the way to the outhouse one night&#x2014;pregnant, shitting herself&#x2014;was not what had finally nudged her and her husband to abandon the homestead. It was the prospect of driving the kids forty minutes to school each day. People who quit the simple life were the rule; I wanted the exceptions.<br><br>In the third group were people who had launched their vision with considerable wealth or inherited land. I met a family who had deftly flipped a house in the suburbs before the crash, paid cash for acreage, and built an off-grid straw-bale house. I envied and admired them, but I couldn't afford to replicate what they'd done. Perhaps the most famous modern homesteader is Ree Drummond, who spun her massively popular Pioneer Woman blog into a series of books and TV shows that extol home cooking and homeschooling. But Drummond acquired her piece of paradise by marrying into a family that ranks among America's largest landowners.<br><br>There were also those from a tradition of simple living, such as the Amish and the Mennonites. But you had to be born into such a culture. You couldn't just join.<br><br>And then there were the moonlighters. Western Montana and southern Utah, where I'd lived for two decades, were meccas for back-to-the-landers, as were Vermont and Northern California. But those places were all expensive now, and buying in these days&#x2014;or even staying afloat&#x2014;required working an outside job to support a homestead hobby. I admired the commitment of those who'd figured out how to make it work. But for me a crucial motivation for living simply was to gain more freedom, not to sprint on some treadmill just to pay the bank.<br><br>"What can I actually do?" asked the British economist E. F. Schumacher in his 1973 book <i>Small Is Beautiful</i>, in the face of intractable tentacles of industry. "In the excitement over the unfolding of his scientific and technical powers," he wrote, "modern man has built a system of production that ravishes nature and a type of society that mutilates man." Meanwhile, the wealthy were stripping the world of its cheap fuels at such a quick rate that poor countries would never get a fair share.<br><br>Schumacher's solution: "We can, each of us, put our inner house in order." He viewed economics through a Buddhist lens, asserting that "the essence of civilization was not in a multiplication of wants but in the purification of human character." Instead of productivity for its own sake, Schumacher heralded the Buddhist ideal of "right livelihood," whose function he defined as threefold: to excel at one's craft, to overcome selfishness by working in common cause with others, and to create useful goods and services.<br><br>Wendell Berry echoed this: "How can a man hope to promote peace in the world if he has not made it possible in his own life and his own household?"<br><br>So after a year of searching for the people who had taken Wendell Berry's challenge to quit destructive technology, I found that I was equally interested in finding people who had taken his challenge to put their households in order.<br><br>Where to find homesteaders more radical, more committed, yet less isolated than the ones I'd met thus far? Not personally knowing any, I launched my search&#x2014;where else?&#x2014;on Facebook. Through a short chain of acquaintances I learned about a place in Missouri, the Possibility Alliance. Some people I met at an anarchist collective told me they had gone there to launch a monthlong bike ride devoted to service&#x2014;a ride they'd all done dressed as superheroes. But in these instantly searchable times, it was surprisingly hard to find out more. The alliance was shrouded in analog mystery: no website or social media, no major press coverage. Was it a commune or a school or an ashram or a summer camp or a training ground for revolutionaries?<br><br>Gradually I gathered this much: Members of the Possibility Alliance used no electricity, cars, or computers. They lived by candlelight and grew their own food and rode bicycles and horses and trains. They lived in voluntary poverty rather than pay an income tax that financed war. Knowledge of the place spread by word of mouth.<br><br>I eventually obtained a phone number&#x2014;landlines don't require electricity&#x2014;and after a series of messages spoke with Ethan Hughes, who, along with his wife, Sarah Wilcox, had founded the Possibility Alliance after they'd disembarked that Amtrak train in La Plata in 2007. He told me that the alliance hosted 1,500 visitors per year, some for a two-hour tour or a half-day course in canning or knitting, others for a weeklong natural-building workshop or a two-week permaculture course.<br><br>"People pull up in the train and are picked up by horse and buggy or by bike," he said. "We call it 'necessary simplicity.' I don't know how to build another planet, but I know how to simplify. It creates a myth. In the age of the Internet, people get bored. There's this mystery. People track us down."<br><br>I asked what sort of people showed up.<br><br>"All kinds. Catholic Workers and anti-religious anarchists, permaculturists and Buddhists." At present they were so inundated with visitors that they could accommodate me only during "Experience Week."<br><br>The price for the nine-day visit: zero. They operated strictly on the "gift economy." I asked what that meant.<br><br>"I see objects and money like water," he said. "It's flowing. If in nature one tree kept all the water, everything downstream would die. By studying nature we see&#x2014;" He stopped mid-sentence.<br><br>"The bell of mindfulness just rang," he said. "Do you mind taking a moment of silence with me?"</p><h2>The Black Cauldron 50th Anniversary Edition: The Chronicles of Prydain, Book 2 (The Chronicles of Prydain, 2)</h2><p><p>Henry Holt Books for Young Readers is proud to publish this 50th Anniversary Edition of Lloyd Alexander's classic Newbery Honor winner <i>The Black Cauldron</i>, the second book in the Chronicles of Prydain, with a new introduction by fellow Newbery Honor winner Rebecca Stead. </p><p>In the land of Prydain, evil is never far away.

He lives in Riverdale, New York.Grade 8-12-- An outstanding book about Napoleon and his era. As the title indicates, Marrin--while not neglecting Napoleon's other accomplishments--focuses on his subject's military genius, with thorough descriptions of weapons, campaigns, battles, and opponents such as Nelson and Wellington. He gives a balanced analysis of Napoleon, does an excellent job of putting things in context, and provides a wealth of detail. Marrin's study is truly fascinating, not merely educational; it should become the definitive work on this period of French history. McGuire's Napoleon (Chelsea, 1986; o.p.), while adequate, is less challenging and less interesting. --Ann W.

What used to be considered signs of success--being busy, having many responsibilities, being involved in many projects or activities--are today being felt as afflictions. The bestselling author of <i>Money and the Meaning of Life,</i> philosopher Jacob Needleman, shows how to take a bold and unconventional approach to time. The aim: to get more out of it by breaking free of our illusions about it. Needleman dispenses with tricks and techniques that only serve to make our obsessiveness more "efficient." Instead he shows how we can understand what our days are for.

The miraculous represents a heavenly power brought down to earth and tied to the life of the community. Understanding how miracles were perceived in the late antiquity requires us to put aside the notion of a miracle as the violation of the natural order. "Miracles" for the church fathers refers to anything that evokes wonder. Rowan Greer is not concerned with conclusions about the truth or falsity of the miracles reported in the ancient sources. He is concerned with how the miracle stories shaped the way people understood Christianity in the fourth and fifth centuries.</p><p>Once the Church gained the predominance in the Empire as part of the Constantinian revolution, most Christians thought that a new Christian commonwealth was in the making. The miracles associated with the cult of the saints (the martyrs and their relics) in the Christian Empire were part of this sacralization. In the Roman imperial church we find a tension between the Christian message, which revolved around virtue and the individual, and corporate piety that focused upon the empowering of the people of God.</p><p>With Augustine we find Christian Platonism transformed into a "new theology" far more congruent with the corporate poetry that had by then developed. An emphasis upon grace and upon God's sovereignty fits a preoccupation with miracles better than the old emphasis upon human freedom and virtue and sets the stages for the Western Middle Ages and the cult of the saints, organized and made central to Christian piety.</p><p>From a study of Roman imperial Christianity before the collapse of the West we discover the tendency to substitute one kind of freedom for another. Freedom as the capacity of human beings to choose the good does not, of course, disappear, but on the whole it is made subordinate to notions of God's sovereign grace and even to an insistence upon the authority of the church.</p></p><p><p>Rowan Allen Greer III is Walter H.

Using a delightful combination of personal correspondence, historical anecdotes, and journal entries, Wheaton effortlessly brings to life the history of the French kitchen and table.</p><p>Barbara Ketcham Wheaton is a noted food historian, writer, and the honorary curator of the culinary collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute. She is also the coauthor, with Patricia Kelly, of <i>Bibliography of Culinary History: Food Resources in Eastern Massachusetts</i>. She teaches seminars on reading historic cookbooks and enjoys lobsters and champagne whenever the opportunity to do so arises.Wheaton's heavily researched, erudite study examines nearly 500 years of French culinary history. Fortunately, the book's animated writing yields a text both entertaining and instructive. Medieval associations between medicinal lore and cookery ingredients are presented in intriguing detail. Wheaton also traces the beginning of France's haute cuisine tradition with the increased publication--in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries--of recipes by outstanding cooks, which were, duly noted by the author, a compelling "inducement to literacy." First issued 15 years ago, Wheaton's inquiry is meticulously descriptive of a culture as presented through the evolving beliefs and tastes associated with the preparation and consumption of food. A final recipe portfolio, though imbued with the doctrines of an era long past, remains relevant with its savory offerings. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>It&#39;s Up to Ourselves: A Mother, a Daughter, and Gurdjieff</h2><p>Case bound, new condition</p><p></p><h2>Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown&#39;s Commentary On the Whole Bible</h2><p>With its scholarly insights, Jamieson, Fausset and Brown&#39;s Commentary is to verse-by-verse exposition what the venerable Matthew Henry&#39;s Commentary is to devotional-style commentaries.

Some were men, others women, Virginia Woolf most famous among the latter. Vita also loved her husband, Harold Nicolson. And he loved her right back. Working with letters and journals, and writing his own explanatory text when necessary, their son, Nigel, has exposed this tangle of passions. In so doing he has performed a great service, showing us two magnificent individuals, not as they meant to be, but as they actually were. Ultimately the marriage "succeeded," according to Nicolson, "because each found permanent and undiluted happiness only in the company of the other." David Case takes the male texts, and Donada Peters those written by Vita. Together they render a stirring, upper-class duet.

"Worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood." Welcome, then, to the pinnacle of the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. Born in Brooklyn in 1930 to recent Irish immigrants Malachy and Angela McCourt, Frank grew up in Limerick after his parents returned to Ireland because of poor prospects in America. It turns out that prospects weren't so great back in the old country either--not with Malachy for a father. A chronically unemployed and nearly unemployable alcoholic, he appears to be the model on which many of our more insulting cliches about drunken Irish manhood are based. Mix in abject poverty and frequent death and illness and you have all the makings of a truly difficult early life. Fortunately, in McCourt's able hands it also has all the makings for a compelling memoir.<blockquote><i> "When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."</i></blockquote> <p> So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy -- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. </p><p> Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. </p><p> <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.</p></p><h2>The Art of Distilling Whiskey and Other Spirits: An Enthusiast&#39;s Guide to the Artisan Distilling of Potent Potables</h2><p><p>This book is a backstage pass into the world of small-scale distilling of whiskies, gins, vodkas, brandies, and more.

Fearing violence after the Senate defeated the "bonus bill," Herbert Hoover's Army Chief of Staff, Douglas MacArthur, led tanks through the streets on July 28 to evict the bonus marchers.</p><p>Through seminal research, including interviews with the last surviving witnesses, Paul Dickson and Thomas B.

Its legacy was of great importance to the World War II veterans whose homecomings were a far cry from the hardships and indignities of the 1930's. That legacy is all the more meaningful today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Janet Maslin, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Bonus Army</i> is one of those half-forgotten chapters in American history that not only richly deserves retelling, but allows you to tell plenty of other good stories along the way. And what a great pleasure it is to have it retold by two old pros like Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen . . . Exactly the kind of book publishers should be giving us more of--responsible popular history, researched to the footnoted standards of the academy but written for the pleasure of general readers who are looking for a good story . . . A rewarding book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kevin Coyne, Newsday</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Bonus Army</i> is a feat of research and analysis--a thoughtful, strong argument that these marches were among the most important demonstrations of the 20th century. Dickson and Allen speculate about why the episode is not more widely known. They cite as possible reasons the encampment's integration in segregated Washington, the ease with which the marchers could be dismissed as Communists, and the fact that no political party stood to gain from the movement's success or failure. Some critics suggest that the authors failed to prove any of these theories or provide any convincing reasons for the Bonus Army's eventual failure. But, Dickson and Allen do paint moving, harrowing portraits of individuals' plights and make clear how the corps' ordeal laid the groundwork for the legislation that became the G.I. Bill of Rights.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bookmarks Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Here a demonstrator is clubbed and tear-gassed, but there real reforms are won: thus unfolds this memorable story of a now-forgotten episode in 20th-century history. The idea that WWI veterans should receive a bonus for their service took years to build and years more to fulfill. As popular historians Dickson and Allen write, part of the delay was a matter of political clout; whereas Civil War vets formed a powerful and populous voting bloc and agitated for pensions, by the time Woodrow Wilson sent troops off to war in Europe, his notion was that soldiers would pay for their own life insurance and 'there would be no demand for postwar compensation to those who were not injured during their service.' Veterans in Oregon thought otherwise, and soon African-American vets from Virginia and hill-country farmers from Tennessee would join in their call for what was now being called a 'bonus' for service. When neither Congress nor presidents would cough up, the vets began to organize nationally, and in 1932 thousands arrived in Washington to protest the Senate's defeat of a bill that would have funds for them. Sure that the leaders were Communists, Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur sent in troops, routing the ethnically mixed protestors and killing some. On hearing the news, Franklin Roosevelt reportedly said to an aide, 'This will elect me,' and indeed it seemed one of the last straws for the Hoover administration. Ironically, the Bonus Army's leadership was far more inclined to the right than the left, so that even as MacArthur was blustering about the Reds, a group of financiers approached a retired Marine Corps general to lead an army of veterans to stage a coup. The general replied, 'If you get these 500,000 soldiers advocating anything smelling of fascism, I am going to get 500,000 more and lick the hell out of you, and we will have real war right at home." The lesson the New Deal government took home: avoid ticking off discontented veterans, whence the GI Bill. A lively, engaging work of history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating and readable book. Recommended.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William D. Pederson, Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;As Dickson and Allen show throughout this empathetic and well-researched volume, the [Bonus Expeditionary Force] meant different things to a number of groups vying for power in the tumultuous political climate of the early '30s. Communist organizers saw the veterans as the shock troops of the emerging 'American Soviet Government'; the Hoover administration viewed them as mostly 'ex-convicts, persons with criminal records, radicals, and non-servicemen' trying to strong-arm the government; and corporate America saw them as competition for dwindling government aid money. To most Americans, however, they were underdogs fighting the government and the corporate corruption that, in their minds, was responsible for the Depression. The book moves beyond these broad generalizations to find the personal stories of the march, fleshing out both minor and major players surrounding the BEF. And in describing the use of tanks, bayonets and tear gas to expel the unarmed vets and their families from Washington--as well as the deadly mistreatment of BEF members in government work camps after the march--Dickson and Allen highlight the sacrifices these women and men made on our own soil to win fair treatment for veterans of future wars. Their important and moving work will appeal to both professional historians and casual readers interested in the history of America's changing attitudes towards its soldiers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Cuba Straits (A Doc Ford Novel)</h2><p><b>The remarkable new novel in the Doc Ford series by <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Randy Wayne White.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Doc Ford&#x2019;s old friend, General Juan Garcia, has gone into the lucrative business of smuggling Cuban baseball players into the U.S. He is also feasting on profits made by buying historical treasures for pennies on the dollar.

Many men died. A few more will hardly be noticed.</p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b> is the author of twenty-one previous Doc Ford novels; the Hannah Smith novels <i>Gone, Deceived, </i>and <i>Haunted</i>; and four collections of nonfiction. He lives on Sanibel Island, Florida, where he was a light-tackle fishing guide for many years.<p>1<br>At sunrise in November, Marion D. Ford, wearing shorts<br>and jungle boots, jogged the tide line where Sanibel Island<br>crescents north, and finally said, &#x201c;Screw it,&#x201d; tired of wind<br>and pelting sand. To his right were colorful cottages&#x2014;red, yellow,<br>green&#x2014;The Castaways, a popular resort during season, but this was<br>Tuesday and a slow time of year. He went to the outdoor shower,<br>thinking he&#x2019;d hide his boots and swim through the breakers. He<br>was ten pounds overweight and sick of his own excuses.<br><br>A porch door opened: a woman backlit by clouds of cinnamon,<br>the sun up but not hot enough to burn through. &#x201c;Want some coffee?&#x201d;<br>She cupped her hands to be heard. &#x201c;Your dog&#x2019;s welcome, if he&#x2019;s sociable.&#x201d;<br><br>No idea who the woman was. Wearing a sweatshirt, with an<br>articulate, strong voice that suggested Midwestern genetics: a descendant<br>of dairymaids good at sports and baking pies. Late thirties, a<br>rental compact in the drive, only one pair of sandals outside the door:<br>a woman on a budget vacationing alone.<br><br>Ford said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m punishing myself.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman replied, &#x201c;You, too?&#x201d; and walked toward him, started<br>to speak but stopped, got up on her toes, focusing on something<br>out there in the waves. &#x201c;What in the world . . . is that someone drowning?&#x201d;<br><br>Beyond the sandbar, Ford saw what might have been a barrel<br>but one thrashing appendage told him was not. He removed his<br>glasses. &#x201c;A loggerhead, I think. This isn&#x2019;t mating season, so it must<br>be hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Logger-what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A sea turtle.&#x201d; Ford handed her his glasses, jogged to the breakers,<br>and duck-dived, still wearing his damn boots. The dog, which was a<br>retriever but not a Lab or golden, swam after him. That was a mistake, too.<br><br>The turtle, barnacles on its back, was tangled in fishing line, and,<br>yes, drowning. Ford had to alternately battle his dog, then the turtle,<br>which hissed and struck like a snake while he maneuvered the thing<br>through waves into the shallows. The woman was impressed. &#x201c;You<br>seem to know what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On rare occasions. Do you have a knife?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to . . . ?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman galloped to the cottage, her sweatshirt bouncing in<br>counter-synch, legs not long but solid. Nice. She watched Ford cut the<br>turtle free, inspect it for cuts, then nurse the animal back through the<br>surf, where he side-stroked alongside for a while.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman was waiting with a towel, coffee in a mug, and water for the dog.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not come inside and dry off? Or a hot shower, if you like,<br>but you&#x2019;ll have to forgive the mess.&#x201d; The look the woman gave him<br>was unmistakable&#x2014;not that Ford often got that look from women<br>he didn&#x2019;t know. &#x201c;Three mornings straight I&#x2019;ve watched you run past<br>here,&#x201d;&#x2014;an awkward smile&#x2014;&#x201c;so I finally worked up the nerve. Is<br>it always this windy in November?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford cleaned his glasses with the towel. &#x201c;Nerve?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Old-fashioned, I guess. You know, speaking to strange men and<br>all that.&#x201d; Another look, eyes aware, before she added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here all alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford tested several excuses before he followed the woman inside.<br>He was thinking,&nbsp;<i>Why do the lonely ones choose islands?</i><br><br>That night in Fort Myers. off Daniels Road, he was at Hammond<br>Stadium, where the Minnesota Twins train, one of the practice<br>fields, listening to his friend Tomlinson ramble on about something,<br>but not really listening.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is why,&#x201d; his friend concluded, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t even watch a game<br>on TV without wearing the ol&#x2019; codpiece.&#x201d;<br><br>Mentioning fish got Ford&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;You caught a cod? They<br>don&#x2019;t migrate this far south.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, man&#x2014;<i>my cup</i>. Until a woman finds an expiration date on<br>my dick, I simply will not risk the Hat Trick Twins.&#x201d; Tomlinson<br>rapped three bell tones from between his legs to illustrate, which<br>proved nothing, because they were sitting in a dugout, under lights,&nbsp;<br>wearing baseball uniforms, not in a bar watching TV. On the field<br>was a Senior League team from Orlando, a left-hander warming<br>up while the umpires kibitzed, game time stalled for no apparent<br>reason.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tomlinson muttered, &#x201c;Geezus, what&#x2019;s the holdup?&#x201d; He grabbed<br>the fence, yelled, &#x201c;Hey, blue&#x2014;while we&#x2019;re still young, okay?&#x201d; before<br>returning to Ford. &#x201c;You seem distracted, ol&#x2019; buddy. Romantic problems<br>or is it something unusual?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford replied, &#x201c;This morning I found a turtle tangled in fishing<br>line&#x2014;one of those crimped wire leaders tourists buy at Walgreens. I<br>assumed it was a loggerhead because they&#x2019;re so common. Now I don&#x2019;t<br>think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was it dead? Goddamn pharmaceutical companies. They&#x2019;d sell<br>Pop-Tarts to diabetics if it bumped their numbers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The turtle was only about fifty pounds but already had barnacles<br>growing. See what I&#x2019;m getting at? Even a young loggerhead or<br>hawksbill would be closer to a hundred. Or maybe I&#x2019;m wrong about<br>that, too. I had him in my hands but didn&#x2019;t bother to notice details.<br>Embarrassing, how little I know about sea turtles. Wouldn&#x2019;t you expect<br>a biologist to notice what the hell species it was?&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson knew the pitcher from Orlando or would not have<br>yelled, &#x201c;Joe . . . Hey, Joey&#x2014;put some color in that rainbow. Slow-pitch<br>is for commies, dude.&#x201d; This ultra-left-wing Zen Buddhist priest (he&#x2019;d<br>been ordained in Japan) and dope-smoking boat bum was a different<br>person when he exited reality and entered a baseball field.<br><br>Joey flipped Tomlinson the bird.<br><br>Ford mused, &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m thinking it might have been a Kemp&#x2019;s<br>Ridley turtle, or even a Pacific Ridley. Two of the rarest in the<br>world&#x2014;the thing snapped at me like a dog, which is typical according<br>to the literature. And its shell was too round. Had it right there in<br>my hands; swam with it and still didn&#x2019;t dawn on me. If that&#x2019;s not a<br>metaphor for something, I don&#x2019;t know what the hell is.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford hunched forward and retied his spikes, Tomlinson saying, &#x201c;I<br>should&#x2019;ve never gotten rid of my old Kangaroos. These new Mizunos<br>pinch my toe rings. I hate that.&#x201d; Then hollered through the screen,<br>&#x201c;Oh great, now I&#x2019;ve got to piss&nbsp;<i>again</i>. Guys . . . I have a Masonic meeting<br>tomorrow. Any chance we&#x2019;ll be done?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Ford sat up. &#x201c;Know what&#x2019;s odd? Two days ago, I was reading<br>about sightings of Pacific Ridleys in the Cuba Straits. I just remembered.<br>Olive Ridleys, actually, but they&#x2019;re the same thing. A few nests<br>documented along this coast, too. Even north of Sarasota.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson reverted to his role as Zen master. &#x201c;Nothing accidental<br>about coincidence, Doc. Hey&#x2014;just listen, for once. You&#x2019;re being<br>nudged toward something. Or away. Or into a new avenue of study.<br>Karma seldom grabs a rational man by the balls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it was a coincidence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not the Cuba part.&#x201d; Ford checked the bleachers&#x2014;only a couple<br>of wives in attendance&#x2014;then found the main field, where stadium<br>lights created a silver dome. Minnesota&#x2019;s minor league team, the Miracle,<br>was playing St. Pete, a few hundred fans in attendance. He said,<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see when he gets here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If he shows up,&#x201d; Ford said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll understand. A friend from&nbsp;<br>Central America. He was drunk when he called, which might explain<br>why he&#x2019;s late. Or might not.&#x201d;<br><br>That made perfect sense to Tomlinson. He nodded, fingering a<br>scar on his temple hidden by scraggly hair&#x2014;a figure eight which he<br>insisted was an infinity symbol.<br><br>&#x201c;Saving that Ridley is the coincidence. If it was a Ridley. The data<br>goes back to 1953&#x2014;one was caught in nets off Pinar del R�o on<br>Cuba&#x2019;s western coast. A few years back, a Ridley was photographed<br>laying eggs near Sarasota. They&#x2019;re not supposed to be in the Gulf or<br>Caribbean, but sea turtles are like underwater birds. They travel anywhere<br>they want; flawless navigation systems, which suggests a magnetic<br>sensitivity that&#x2019;s still not understood. It crossed my mind I&#x2019;ve<br>never actually seen a Ridley. Not confirmed anyway, which is why<br>I&#x2019;m pissed at myself about this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson&#x2019;s attention focused. &#x201c;<i>Really</i>? You sure that&#x2019;s the only<br>reason?&#x201d; He said it as if envisioning a woman who was lonely and<br>alone in her vacation cottage. Then added, &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re not thinking<br>about going back to Cuba. That&#x2019;s risking jail, man; a firing squad,<br>from what I remember. Or has something changed?&#x201d;<br><br>Ford shrugged, adjusted his protective gear, and buckled his pants.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask Victor to catch the first few innings. He might have gone to<br>the wrong field.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vic? No . . . he went to his car to get eye black. What about Cuba?<br>You know I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not him. The guy I was talking about.&#x201d;<br><br>Tomlinson said to Ford, whose spikes clicked as he walked away,<br>&#x201c;Not if I&#x2019;m called in to pitch, you&#x2019;re not leaving. Hey . . .&nbsp;<i>Whoa</i>! Do&nbsp;<br>you have a death wish or get dumped again? Dude . . . I can talk you<br>through this.&#x201d;<br><i><br>There is a fine line between getting dumped and a relationship<br>ended by the unanimous vote of one.</i><br><br>Ford thought about that as he walked past the spring training<br>clubhouse, across the parking lot to the stadium, into a tunnel of noise<br>and odors: popcorn, beer, and grilled brats. Cuba was also on his<br>mind. What Tomlinson said would&#x2019;ve been true a few years ago but<br>might be okay now with the right cover story&#x2014;or a companion with<br>the right political ties.<br><br>The man he was searching for had those ties.<br><br>Ford spotted him in the outfield cheap seats, alone above the bull<br>pen. The nearest cluster of fans was three sections closer to third base.<br>The man had been watching relief pitchers warm up, not the game,<br>but was now arguing with two security cops.<br><br>No doubt who it was, even from a distance. The man&#x2019;s size and his<br>choice of seats would have been enough.<br><br>Baseball spikes are tricky on aluminum. It took Ford awhile to get<br>to left field and intervene on behalf of the man who was an old<br>enemy and sometimes a friend&#x2014;General Juan Sim�n Rivera, recently<br>arrived from Central America via Havana.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell them,&#x201d; Rivera said in English when he spotted Ford. &#x201c;Tell<br>them who I am. Perhaps they will understand that diplomatic immunity<br>includes baseball and cigars.&#x201d;<br>He&#x2019;d been smoking a Cohiba, that was the problem.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ford replied in Spanish. &#x201c;You want me to blow your cover, General?&#x201d;<br>This was safe to ask in front of two Anglo sheriffs deputies<br>who resembled farmhands.<br><br>Rivera, the former dictator of Masagua, a tiny country that exported<br>bananas and revolution, got control of himself. Decided,<br>&#x201c;Hmm. A man of my intellect is seldom a donkey&#x2019;s ass, but good<br>point. Yes . . . better to indulge these fascists&#x2014;for now.&#x201d; Spoke loudly<br>in slang Spanish, then waited with regal impatience while Ford pacified the cops.<br><br>When they were gone, Ford endured a bear hug; they exchanged<br>pleasantries&#x2014;who was married, how many wives, how many kids.<br>Rivera, finally getting to it, said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you recognized me.<br>I&#x2019;ve come incognito for a reason.&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of signature khakis and boots, he wore a yellow Hawaiian<br>shirt, a Disney visor, and flip-flops. Not enough to disguise a husky<br>Latino with a gray-splotched beard and wild Russian hair, but Ford<br>played along.<br><br>&#x201c;A European tourist, General, that&#x2019;s what I thought at first. Very<br>clever.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, it took me awhile.&#x201d;<br><br>Rivera expected that. It was a game they played, informal formality,<br>but each man knew the truth about the other. He said, &#x201c;Sometimes<br>a wolf must blend with the sheep. Yet, not clever enough to fool<br>you, my old catcher friend.&#x201d; He noticed Ford&#x2019;s uniform &#x201c;Why are you<br>not on the field? I might even agree to pitch a few innings . . .&nbsp;<i>if</i>&nbsp;you<br>have a large uniform. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be clean, but it cannot be an<br>even number. I&#x2019;m partial to the numbers three, nine, and thirtyseven.&#x201d;<br>With his hands, he gestured:&nbsp;<i>I think you understand</i>.<br><br>Santer�a, a mix of Catholicism and voodoo, was big on numerology,<br>especially when it came to baseball. Rivera was devoted to the<br>game. In Central America, he had built his own field in the rainforest<br>and drafted soldiers based on their batting averages. He fancied<br>himself a great pitcher whose politics had ruined his shot at the major leagues.<br><br>Ford replied, &#x201c;General, my teammates would be honored. But,<br>first . . . why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Always the same with you, Marion. Rush, rush, rush. Only bachelorhood<br>has spared you ulcers, I think.&#x201d; Rivera nodded to the bull<br>pen, where a pitcher who looked sixteen but was almost seven feet<br>tall, sat with his hat askew. &#x201c;That is Ruben. He&#x2019;s one of my prot�g�s.<br>The Twins have offered him a tryout, but a mere formality. Ruben&#x2019;s<br>fastball rivals my own, yet he is a southpaw, as you can tell from his<br>sombrero.&#x201d;<br><br>A joke.&nbsp;<i>Gorro</i>&nbsp;was Spanish for &#x201c;cap.&#x201d; The general was in a pawky mood.<br><br>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t be from Masagua. I never saw anyone from Masagua<br>much over six feet&#x2014;except for you. Are you his agent?&#x201d;<br>Rivera touched an index finger to his lips. &#x201c;Unfortunately, the<br>situation requires that Ruben pretends he doesn&#x2019;t know me. I can&#x2019;t<br>explain right now.&#x201d;<br>Ford could guess where this was going but waited.<br>&#x201c;I have an interesting proposition, Marion.&#x201d;<br>Ford said, &#x201c;In Cuba.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I told you as much on the phone. A nice chunk of silver in U.S.<br>dollars if you agree.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford sensed trouble but also escape: turtles, isolated beaches, a<br>land without cell phones&#x2014;if he wasn&#x2019;t arrested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll listen, but I don&#x2019;t<br>do that sort of work anymore. Not if it&#x2019;s dangerous. Or political<br>work&#x2014;count me out if politics are involved.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t ruled out<br>human trafficking in deference to his own curiosity.<br><br>&#x201c;Politics?&#x201d; Rivera said. &#x201c;I spit on the word. I piss on their speeches.<br>To hell with their silly games. I am a freedom fighter&#x2014;always&#x2014;but<br>have learned there are benefits to this free enterprise system of yours.<br>A man is allowed to change, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only the small-minded hate change, General.&#x201d;<br><br>In clumsy English, Rivera replied, &#x201c;You can say that twice. We<br>will feast ourselves several days in Cuba. A week at most, every expenses<br>paid. But, first&#x201d;&#x2014;he hesitated while shifting to Spanish&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a little problem here that must be dealt with.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In Florida?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let us hope so.&#x201d; Rivera leaned closer to speak over the noise of<br>the PA system. &#x201c;I have lost a baseball player. Temporarily, I&#x2019;m sure,<br>but it would be unwise to contact your police.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long has he been missing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not &#x2018;missing&#x2019;; &#x2018;wandered off.&#x2019; Since this morning, when I visited<br>his motel&#x2014;a place not far from here, with a large red sign. Without<br>shoes or money, the lunatic could not have gone far.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s crazy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well . . . no more than most, but he&#x2019;s not as smart as normal men.<br>And honest, very honest, which makes him unpredictable.&#x201d;<br><br>Ford had spent much of his life on the water and in baseball dug-<br>outs, which is why he asked, &#x201c;Were his glove and bat missing?

Bowles then returned his energies to the short story -- the genre he preferred and soon mastered.</p><p>Bowles's short fiction is orchestral in composition and exacting in theme, marked by a unique, delicately spare style and a dark, rich, exotic mood, by turns chilling, ironic, and wry. In "Pastor Dowe at Tacat�," a Protestant missionary is sent to the far reaches of the globe -- a place, he discovers, where his God has no power. In "Call at Coraz�n," an American husband abandons his alcoholic wife on their honeymoon in a South American jungle. In "Allal," a boy's drug-induced metamorphosis into a deadly serpent leads to his violent death, but not before he feels the "joy" of sinking his fangs into human prey. Also gathered here are Bowles's most famous works, such as "The Delicate Prey," a grimly satisfying tale of vengeance, and "A Distant Episode," which Tennessee Williams proclaimed "a masterpiece of short fiction."</p><p>"Beauty and terror go wonderfully well together in [Bowles's] work," Madison Smartt Bell once said. Though sometimes shocking, Bowles's stories have a symmetry that is haunting and ultimately moral. Like Poe (whose stories Bowles's mother read to him at bedtime), Bowles had an instinctive adeptness with the nightmare vision. Joyce Carol Oates, in her introduction to <em>Too Far from Home,</em> writes that his characters are "at the mercy of buried wishes experienced as external fate." In these masterful stories, our deepest fears are manifest, tables are turned, and allegiances are tested. Fate is an inexorable element of Bowles's distant landscapes, and its psychological effects on his characters are rendered with penetrating accuracy. Like Hemingway, Bowles is famously unsentimental, a skilled craftsman of crystalline prose.</p></p><p><p>Paul Bowles was born in 1910 and studied music with composer Aaron Copland before moving to Tangier, Morocco. A devastatingly imaginative observer of the West's encounter with the East, he is the author of four highly acclaimed novels: <em>The Sheltering Sky</em>, <em>Let It Come Down</em>, <em>The Spider's House</em>, and <em>Up Above the World</em>. In addition to being one of the most powerful postwar American novelists, Bowles was an acclaimed composer, a travel writer, a poet, a translator, and a short story writer. He died in Morocco in 1999.</p>As elusive as his enigmatic fiction, which is epitomized by the 1949 autobiographical bestselling novel, The Sheltering Sky, Bowles (1910-2001) arguably has been venerated as much for being the mythical forerunner of the Beat Generation as for his considerable genius, both musical and literary. A darling of iconoclastic literati both here and abroad, he first became known as a composer, writing music for stage and screen. Only after his marriage to Jane Auer (herself soon to become a cultishly popular writer under the name Jane Bowles) in 1938 did he turn seriously to fiction. The exotic settings of the 62 stories collected in this landmark volume reflect the wanderings of nomadic Paul and Jane as, during the '30s and '40s, they flitted from Europe to Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S. before finally settling in Tangiers in 1949. Over the years, Bowles's fascination with Western man's intrinsic decadence, laid bare in clashes with exotic cultures, became the signature motif of his existential fiction ("The Hours After Noon" and "Too Far from Home"). His oblique language and abrupt endings ("At Paso Rojo") are curiously confounding, and his tales are invariably charged with subterranean currents. Frankly incestuous and homosexual, "Pages from Cold Point" is almost certain to stir anew speculation about Bowles's sexual orientation. Earthy, violent and comfortable with corruption, these deeply affecting stories are distinguished by their lyrical rhythms and meticulous regard for language. The assemblage of this impressive collection marks a literary event of the highest order. (Oct.)Forecast: This definitive volume will be a must-have for all major libraries, and should attract much review attention and feature coverage. Bowles cofounded Antaeus magazine with Daniel Halpern in 1968, and soon afterward the magazine became the Ecco Press. This collection is being published to coincide with Ecco's 30th anniversary, and publisher Halpern will be available to discuss his longtime friendship with Bowles. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Whodunit: A Guide to Crime, Suspense, and Spy Fiction</h2><p>Surveys the history of the different types of fiction concerning crime, offers advice on how to write mysteries, and rates the various crime writers and their novels</p><p></p><h2>The Tea Rose: A Novel</h2><p>East London, 1888-a city apart.

Fast delivery through DHL/FedEx express.</p><p>With <i>The Golden Compass</i> Philip Pullman garnered every accolade under the sun. Critics lobbed around such superlatives as "elegant," "awe-inspiring," "grand," and "glittering," and used "magnificent" with gay abandon. Each reader had a favorite chapter--or, more likely, several--from the opening tour de force to Lyra's close call at Bolvangar to the great armored-bear battle. And Pullman was no less profligate when it came to intellectual firepower or singular characters. The d�mons alone grant him a place in world literature. Could the second installment of his trilogy keep up this pitch, or had his heroine and her too, too sullied parents consumed him? And what of the belief system that pervaded his alternate universe, not to mention the mystery of Dust? More revelations and an equal number of wonders and new players were definitely in order.<p> <i>The Subtle Knife</i> offers everything we could have wished for, and more. For a start, there's a young hero--from our world--who is a match for Lyra Silvertongue and whose destiny is every bit as shattering. Like Lyra, Will Parry has spent his childhood playing games. Unlike hers, though, his have been deadly serious. This 12-year-old long ago learned the art of invisibility: if he could erase himself, no one would discover his mother's increasing instability and separate them. </p><p> As the novel opens, Will's enemies will do anything for information about his missing father, a soldier and Arctic explorer who has been very much airbrushed from the official picture. Now Will must get his mother into safe seclusion and make his way toward Oxford, which may hold the key to John Parry's disappearance. But en route and on the lam from both the police and his family's tormentors, he comes upon a cat with more than a mouse on her mind: "She reached out a paw to pat something in the air in front of her, something quite invisible to Will." What seems to him a patch of everyday Oxford conceals far more: "The cat stepped forward and vanished." Will, too, scrambles through and into another oddly deserted landscape--one in which children rule and adults (and felines) are very much at risk. Here in this deathly silent city by the sea, he will soon have a dustup with a fierce, flinty little girl: "Her expression was a mixture of the very young--when she first tasted the cola--and a kind of deep, sad wariness." Soon Will and Lyra (and, of course, her d�mon, Pantalaimon) uneasily embark on a great adventure and head into greater tragedy.</p><p> As Pullman moves between his young warriors and the witch Serafina Pekkala, the magnetic, ever-manipulative Mrs. Coulter, and Lee Scoresby and his hare d�mon, Hester, there are clear signs of approaching war and earthly chaos. There are new faces as well. The author introduces Oxford dark-matter researcher Mary Malone; the Latvian witch queen Ruta Skadi, who "had trafficked with spirits, and it showed"; Stanislaus Grumman, a shaman in search of a weapon crucial to the cause of Lord Asriel, Lyra's father; and a serpentine old man whom Lyra and Pan can't quite place. Also on hand are the Specters, beings that make cliff-ghasts look like rank amateurs. </p><p> Throughout, Pullman is in absolute control of his several worlds, his plot and pace equal to his inspiration. Any number of astonishing scenes--small- and large-scale--will have readers on edge, and many are cause for tears. "You think things have to be <i>possible</i>," Will demands. "Things have to be <i>true</i>!" It is Philip Pullman's gift to turn what quotidian minds would term the impossible into a reality that is both heartbreaking and beautiful. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"JUST AS QUICK-MOVING AND UNPUTDOWNABLE AS [THE GOLDEN COMPASS] . . .

She had a lonely heart, an estranged son, and a big secret.

My first book, <i>Killing Floor</i>, came out in 1997. It probably sold some copies on Amazon, but not many, because the company was in its infancy then, barely two years old. In that book I even referred to &#x201c;an e-mail,&#x201d; thinking I was showing two of the characters to be amazingly cutting-edge and modern.<br> <p>A year or so later I actually got e-mail, and a year or so after that I got a web site, and a couple of years after that I got broadband, and over the following few years I got into the habit of starting the day internet surfing, reading the news and the gossip.</p> <p>But it is not until now that I can say that one of my books--the thirteenth Reacher thriller, <i>Gone Tomorrow</i>--is truly and exclusively a product of the internet age.</p> <p>I started the surfing years in a sensible, structured manner, but I eventually learned that the best stuff comes randomly. I started to follow links on a whim, bouncing from place to place, Googling other people&#x2019;s references, following the maze, looking for rabbit holes.</p> <p>I found an anonymous police blog from Britain.</p> <p>It was apparently hosted by a London copper, and because it was secure and anonymous it was uninhibited. The people who posted there said all kinds of things. There were complaints and there was bitching, of course, but also there was a frank and unexpurgated view of police work from behind the lines. I got there in the summer of 2005, just after the suicide bombings on London&#x2019;s transportation system, and just after a completely innocent Brazilian student had been shot to death by London police, who were under the mistaken impression that the guy had been involved.</p> <p>Now, as a thriller writer, I&#x2019;m familiar with the idea that cops can be bent or reckless. But I&#x2019;m equally aware that&#x2019;s mostly literary license. I know lots of cops, and they&#x2019;re great people doing a very tough job. Years ago I met a friend&#x2019;s eight-year-old daughter--a sweet little girl with no front teeth--and she grew up to be a cop. She won a bravery medal for a difficult solo arrest during which she was stabbed and had her thumb broken. She&#x2019;s tough, but she&#x2019;s not bent or reckless. So are the other cops I know.</p> <p>So I was curious: what happened with the Brazilian kid? How was the mistake made?</p> <p>So I eavesdropped while the coppers on the anonymous site were asking the same question. And I learned something interesting.</p> <p>Their first consensus explanation was: because of &#x201c;the list.&#x201d; The Brazilian boy was showing &#x201c;all twelve signs.&#x201d; I thought, what list? What signs? So I clicked and scrolled and Googled, and it turned out that years earlier Israeli counterintelligence had developed a failsafe checklist of physical and behavioral signifiers, that when all present and correct mean you are looking at a suicide bomber. The list had entered training manuals, and after 9/11 those manuals were studied like crazy all over the world. And the response was mandatory: you see a guy showing the signs, you put him down, right now, before he can blow himself up.</p> <p>And by sheer unlucky coincidence, the Brazilian kid had been showing the signs. A winter coat in July, a recent shave, and so on. (Read <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> if you want to know all twelve, and why.) </p> <p>All writing is what if? So I tried to imagine that moment of... disbelief, I guess. You see a guy showing the signs, and probably every fiber of your being is saying, &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be.&#x201d; But you&#x2019;re required to act.</p> <p>So for the opening scene of <i>Gone Tomorrow</i>, I had Reacher sitting on a subway train in New York City, staring at a woman who is showing the signs. Reacher is ex-military law enforcement, and he knows the list forward and backward. Half of his brain is saying, &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be,&#x201d; and the other half is programmed to act. What does he do? What if he&#x2019;s wrong? What will happen?</p> <p>That&#x2019;s where the story starts. It ends hundreds of pages later, in a place you both do and don&#x2019;t expect. --<i>Lee Child</i></p> <p>(Photo � Sigrid Estrada)</p><b>Lee Child&nbsp;</b>is the author of nineteen&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Jack Reacher thrillers, ten of which have reached the #1 position.

Born to a prosperous Prussian mercantile family, he spent his life working in the Manchester cotton industry, riding to the Cheshire hounds, and enjoying the comfortable upper-middle-class existence of a Victorian gentleman. <br>Yet Engels was also, with Karl Marx, the founder of international communism, which in the twentieth century came to govern one-third of the human race. He was the coauthor of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, a ruthless party tactician, and the man who sacrificed his best years so that Marx could write <i>Das Kapital</i>. His searing account of the Industrial Revolution, <i>The Condition of the Working Class in England</i>, remains one of the most haunting and brutal indictments of the human costs of capitalism. Far more than Marx&#x2019;s indispensable aide, Engels was a profound thinker in his own right&#x2014;on warfare, feminism, urbanism, Darwinism, technology, and colonialism. With fierce clarity, he predicted the social effects of today&#x2019;s free-market fundamentalism and unstoppable globalization.<br>Drawing on a wealth of letters and archives, acclaimed historian Tristram Hunt plumbs Engels&#x2019;s intellectual legacy and shows us how one of the great <i>bon viveurs</i> of Victorian Britain reconciled his exuberant personal life with his radical political philosophy. Set against the backdrop of revolutionary Europe and industrializing England&#x2014;of Manchester mills, Paris barricades, and East End strikes&#x2014;<i>Marx&#x2019;s General</i> tells a story of devoted friendship, class compromise, ideological struggle, and family betrayal. And it tackles head-on the question of Engels&#x2019;s influence: was Engels, after Marx&#x2019;s death, responsible for some of the most devastating turns of twentieth-century history, or was the idealism of his thought distorted by those who claimed to be his followers?<br>An epic history and riveting biography, <i>Marx&#x2019;s General </i>at last brings Engels out from the shadow of his famous friend and collaborator.<br></p><p><p>Tristram Hunt is a lecturer in history at the University of London. The author of <i>Building Jerusalem: The Rise and Fall of the Victorian City</i>, he writes political and cultural commentary for <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Times</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>, among other publications. </p><p>Preface</p><p>On 30 June 1869, Friedrich Engels, a Manchester mill owner, gave up his job in the family business after nearly twenty years. Ready to greet him on his return to his small cottage in the Chorlton suburbs were his lover Lizzy Burns and houseguest Eleanor Marx, daughter of his old friend Karl. "I was with Engels when he reached the end of his forced labour and I saw what he must have gone through all those years," Eleanor later wrote of Engels's final day at work. "I shall never forget the triumph with which he exclaimed 'for the last time!' as he put on his boots in the morning to go to his office. A few hours later we were standing at the gate waiting for him. We saw him coming over the little field opposite the house where he lived. He was swinging his stick in the air and singing, his face beaming. Then we set the table for a celebration and drank champagne and were happy."1</p><p>Friedrich Engels was a textile magnate and foxhunter, a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange, and president of the city's Schiller Institute. He was a raffish, high-living, heavy-drinking devotee of the good things in life: lobster salad, Ch�teau Margaux, Pilsener beer, and expensive women. But Engels also for forty years funded Karl Marx, looked after his children, soothed his furies, and provided one half of history's most celebrated ideological partnership as coauthor of The Communist Manifesto and cofounder of what would come to be known as Marxism. Over the course of the twentieth century, from Chairman Mao's China to the Stasi state of the GDR, from the anti-imperial struggle in Africa to the Soviet Union itself, various manifestations of this compelling philosophy would cast their shadow over a full third of the human race. And as often as not, the leaders of the socialist world would look first to Engels rather than Marx to explain their policies, justify their excesses, and shore up their regimes. Interpreted and misinterpreted, quoted and misquoted, Friedrich Engels&#x2014;the frock-coated Victorian cotton lord&#x2014;became one of the central architects of global communism.</p><p>Today, a journey to Engels begins at Moscow's Paveletsky rail station. From this shabbily romantic tsarist-era terminal, the rusting sleeper train heaves off at midnight for the Volga plains hundreds of miles southeast of the capital. A grinding, stop-start fourteen-hour journey, alleviated only by a gurgling samovar in the guard's carriage, eventually lands you in the city of Saratov with its wide, tree-lined streets and attractive air of lost grandeur.</p><p>Bolted onto this prosperous provincial center is a crumbling six-lane highway that bridges the mighty Volga and connects Saratov to its unloved sister city, Engels. Lacking any of Saratov's sophistication, Engels is a seedy, forgotten site dominated by railway loading docks and the rusting detritus of light industry. At its civic center squats Engels Square, a bleak parade ground encircled by housing projects, a shabby strip mall dotted with sports bars, casinos, and DVD stores, and a roundabout clogged with Ladas, Sputniks, and the odd Ford. Here, in all its enervating grime, is the postcommunist Russia of hypercapitalism and bootleg Americana. And amid this free market dystopia stands a statue of Friedrich Engels himself. Fifteen feet high, atop a marble plinth and with a well-tended municipal flower bed at his feet, he looks resplendent in his trench coat, clutching a curling copy of The Communist Manifesto.</p><p>Across the former USSR and Eastern bloc, the statues of Marx (together with those of Lenin, Stalin, and Beria) have come down. Decapitated and mutilated, their remains are gathered together in monument graveyards for the ironic edification of Cold War cultural tourists. Inexplicably, Engels has been given leave to remain, still holding sway over his eponymous town. As a quick conversation with local residents and early-evening promenaders in Engels Square reveals, his presence here is the product neither of affection nor of admiration. Certainly, there is little hostility toward the cofounder of communism but rather a nonchalant indifference and weary apathy. Like the myriad plinths laden with nineteenth-century generals and long-forgotten social reformers that litter the squares of Western European capitals, Engels has become an unknown and unremarkable part of the civic wallpaper.</p><p>In his birthplace, in the Rhineland town of Wuppertal (now a commuter suburb for the nearby finance and fashion city of D�sseldorf), a similar disinterest is evident. There is a Friedrich Engels Strasse and a Friedrich Engels Allee but little sense of a town overly eager to commemorate its most celebrated son. The site of Engels's Geburtshaus, destroyed by a Royal Air Force bombing raid in 1943, remains barren and all that marks the place of his arrival into the world is a dirty granite monument modestly noting his role as the "cofounder of scientific socialism." Covered in holly and ivy, it is edged into the shadowy corner of a run-down park, overlooked by aging portable toilets and a vandalized phone booth.</p><p>In modern Russia and Germany, let alone in Spain, England, or America, Engels has slipped the bonds of history. Where once his name was on the lips of millions&#x2014;as Marx's fellow combatant, as the author of&nbsp;Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (the bible of global communism), as the theoretician of dialectical materialism, as the name regularly grafted onto city streets and squares by revolutionary insurgents and left-wing councils, as the man whose visionary, bearded features appeared on the currency and in textbooks and, alongside Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, stared down from vast flags and Soviet Realist billboards onto May Day parades&#x2014;it is now barely registered in either East or West. In 1972, an official GDR biography could claim that "nowadays there is hardly a corner of this earth of ours where Engels's name has not been heard of, where the significance of his work is unknown."2 Today, he is so innocuous his statue isn't even pulled down.</p><p>The same cannot be said of his colleague Karl Marx. Two decades on from the fall of the Berlin Wall and Francis Fukuyama's hubristic declaration of "the end of history," Marx's reputation is enjoying a remarkable renaissance. In recent years, he has been transformed from the ogre responsible for the killing fields of Cambodia and labor camps of Siberia to modern capitalism's most perceptive analyst. "Marx's Stock Resurges on a 150-Year Tip" was how the New York Times marked the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Communist Manifesto&#x2014;a text that, more than any other, "recognized the unstoppable wealth-creating power of capitalism, predicted it would conquer the world, and warned that this inevitable globalization of national economies and cultures would have divisive and painful consequences."3 As Western governments, businesses, and banks faced an economic hurricane of free market fundamentalism at the turn of the twenty-first century&#x2014;financial meltdowns in Mexico and Asia, the industrialization of China and India, the decimation of the middle class in Russia and Argentina, mass migration, and a worldwide "crisis of capitalism" in 2007-09&#x2014;the Cassandra-like voice of Marx started to echo down the decades. The post-1989 neoliberal capitalist consensus, Fukuyama's endpoint of mankind's ideological evolution all set to be built on the historical wreck of communism, seemed to falter. And there was Marx waiting in the wings. "He's back," screamed the Times in the autumn of 2008 as stock markets plunged, banks were nationalized, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was photographed leafing through Das Kapital (sales of which surged to the top of the German best-seller lists). Even Pope Benedict XVI was moved to praise Marx's "great analytical skill."4 The British economist Meghnad Desai, in a work that formed part of an increasingly effusive literature on Marx, had already labeled the phenomenon "Marx's revenge."5</p><p>For it was now a truth universally acknowledged that Marx was the first to chart the uncompromising, unrelenting, compulsively destructive nature of capitalism. "It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interests, than callous 'cash-payment,' " as The Communist Manifesto puts it. "It has drowned the most heavenly ecstacies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation."6 It was Marx who revealed how capitalism would crush languages, cultures, traditions, even nations in its wake. "In one word, it creates a world after its own image," he wrote long before globalization became a byword for Americanization. In his best-selling 2005 biography, Karl Marx, ou l'esprit du monde, the French politician-cum-banker Jacques Attali located Marx as the first great theorist of globalization. Even the Economist, the great weekly promulgator of neoliberal dogma, had to give him credit for "envisioning the awesome productive power of capitalism." As the magazine conceded in a 2002 article entitled "Marx after Communism," "he saw that capitalism would spur innovation to a hitherto-unimagined degree. He was right that giant corporations would come to dominate the world's industries."7 At the same time, Attali's book, together with Francis Wheen's popular biography of Marx (Karl Marx, 1999), helped cast the man in a sympathetic light as a struggling journalist, endearing rapscallion, and loving father.8 Since the 1960s and Louis Althusser's "discovery" of the "epistemological break" between the young and mature Marx&#x2014;between the Marx of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts concerned with alienation and morality and the later, materialist Marx&#x2014;we had already come to know of Karl Marx's early philosophical humanism. Now we were offered the biographical complement of a rounded, engaging, and strikingly contemporary individual.</p><p>Where does Friedrich Engels fit within this generous new alignment? ...</p></p><h2>Christy</h2><p>Adventure, romance, and faith come together in this inspiring coming-of-age story by one of America&#x2019;s cherished writersIn 1912, and against the wishes of her parents, nineteen-year-old Christy Huddleston leaves her life of privilege and ease to become a missionary teacher in an impoverished and isolated valley in the Smoky Mountains. The job turns out to be more difficult--and rewarding--than she had anticipated, as she comes to know and care for the wild mountain people with their fierce pride, terrible poverty, dark superstitions, and their yearning for beauty and truth.Her faith is severely tested--by her students and by the suffering of the people she comes to love. When her dearest friend is taken by a typhoid epidemic, Christy questions the sovereignty and power of God.And when two remarkable young men fall in love with her--the pastor who is drawn to her courage and independence, and the non-Christian doctor who is drawn to the light of Christ shining through her--her heart is torn between love and desire.Based on the life of author Catherine Marshall&#x2019;s mother, Leonora Whitaker, Christy has sold over ten million copies since it was first published in 1967 and is the inspiration for a new PAX television mini-series of the same name. Christy is the novel that helped define Christian fiction as we know it today, and now--for the first time--this beautifully told tale of love and faith is available in a trade paper edition.</p><p>When Christy Huddleston leaves a life of privilege and ease to teach in the impoverished Smokey Mountains, her faith is severely tested by her pupils, the love of two men, and the curious customs of the mountain people in her community. Yet she grows to love these people and the simple, fulfilling lifestyle to be found in the heart of God's country. First released in 1967, <i>Christy</i> is based on the life of author Catherine Marshall's mother and was the inspiration for the recent television series of the same name. Beautifully told, this is a charming, timeless tale of love and faith that will appeal to romance readers of all ages. <i>--Maudeen Wachsmith</i>The late, best-selling author Catherine Marshall wrote a number of books, including Christy, A Man Called Peter, Beyond Our Selves, The Helper, Adventures in Prayer, and Something More.</p><h2>Zulu : The Heroism and Tragedy of the Zulu War of 1879</h2><p>This was the most controversial and brutal British imperial conflict of the nineteenth century. The real story of the Anglo-Zulu war was one of deception, dishonour, incompetence and dereliction of duty by Lord Chelmsford who invaded Zululand without the knowledge of the British Government. But it did not go to plan and there were many political repercussions. Using new material from archives in Britain and South Africa, Saul David blows the lid on this most sordid of imperial wars and comes to a number of startling new conclusions.</p><p>Saul David is an author and broadcaster. He was born in 1966 and educated at Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, receiving his history doctorate in 2001.

In an ongoing quest to find human connection, he badgers friend and stranger alike into a series of onesided conversations, punctuating his own lofty discursions with a brutally honest, self-negating sense of humor. After his father dies, Wilson, now irrevocably alone, sets out to find his ex-wife with the hope of rekindling their long-dead relationship, and discovers he has a teenage daughter, born after the marriage ended and given up for adoption.Wilson eventually forces all three to reconnect as a family&#x2015;a doomed mission that will surely, inevitably backfire. </p><p>In the first all-new graphic novel from one of the leading cartoonists of our time, Daniel Clowes creates a thoroughly engaging, complex, and fascinating portrait of the modern egoist&#x2015;outspoken and oblivious to the world around him.Working in a single-page-gag format and drawing in a spectrumof styles, the cartoonist of <i>GhostWorld</i>, <i>Ice Haven</i>, and <i>David Boring </i>gives us his funniest and most deeply affecting novel to date.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2010</strong>: <em>Wilson</em> is billed as Daniel Clowes's "first original graphic novel," which sounds a little funny, since he's the author of <em>Ghost World</em>, one of the instant classics of that young genre, as well as the lesser-known but strangely wonderful <em>David Boring</em>, among others. But his other books first appeared serialized in his Eightball comics series, while <em>Wilson</em> comes to us all at once, in a beautiful oversized package. <em>Wilson</em> tells a single, complete story (of the bitterly lonely man named in the title), but it does so in tiny bites. Each page is a stand-alone vignette, in the familiar newspaper comics rhythm of setup, setup, setup, punch line: like Garfield, say, if Jon were a foul-mouthed incipient felon (and drawn with the tenderly grotesque genius of Clowes). The gags are the sort that stick in your throat rather than go down easy, and together they add up to a life that's just barely open to the possibility of wresting oneself out of the repetitions of hostility and failure. It's an intriguing addition to the most thrilling career in comics. --<em>Tom Nissley</em><p><b>DANIEL CLOWES</b> is the author of the seminal comic book series <i>Eightball</i>, the screenwriter of <i>Ghost World </i>and <i>Art School Confidential</i>, and an illustrator for <i>The New Yorker</i>.He is married and lives in Oakland, California.</p></p><h2>Thief of Shadows (Maiden Lane, 4)</h2><p><b>A MASKED MAN . . . </b><br><br>Winter Makepeace lives a double life.

Kindred Spirit</p><h2>Lady of Quality</h2><p>The time and place is Bath in the last years of the Regency -- a setting Georgette Heyer has made peculiarly her own. In Lady of Quality, she limns the social rounds of Bath -- the dances, the teas, the mornings in the Pump Room -- more convincingly and delightfully than ever. The lady of quality is Miss Annis Wychwood, rich, beautiful, independent, and, at twenty-nine, considered long past marriageable age. She lives in her own house in Bath with an elderly and garrulous cousin, foisted on her by her very correct brother, Sir Geoffrey Wychwood, to keep tongues from wagging. When Miss Wychwood agrees to take Lucilla Carleton, an engaging seventeen-year-old heiress, under her wing, the arrangement is condemned by almost everyone -- her scandalized chaperon, Sir Geoffrey, and Lord Beckenham, her most persistent suitor. The only exception is Lucilla&#39;s guardian, Mr. Oliver Carleton, known by all to be the rudest man in London. With its charming heroine and outrageous but finally irresistible hero, Lady of Quality is one of Miss Heyer&#39;s most light-hearted and spirited romances. Her ever-increasing throng of readers will find her at the top of her form.</p><p>Georgette Heyer wrote over fifty novels, including Regency romances, mysteries, and historical fiction. She was known as the Queen of Regency romance, and was legendary for her research, historical accuracy, and her extraordinary plots and characterizations.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>The elegant travelling carriage which bore Miss Wychwood from her birthplace, on the border of Somerset and Wiltshire, to her home in Bath, proceeded on its way at a decorous pace. This was dictated by her coachman, an elderly autocrat, who, having known her from the day of her birth, almost thirty years before, drove her at the pace he considered proper, and turned a deaf ear to her requests to him to &#x2018;put 'em along!' If she didn't know what was due to her consequence, as Miss Wychwood of Twynham Park, he did; and even if she was an old maid in fact, almost an ape-leader, though he would never call her one, and had turned off the impudent stable-boy who had dared to do so, after giving him a rare box on the ear he knew very well how his late master would have wished his only daughter to be driven about the country. He had a pretty good idea, too, of what Sir Thomas would have felt had he known that Miss Wychwood had set up her own establishment in Bath, a few months after his death, with only a squinny old Tough to lend her countenance. A mean bit, Miss Farlow, if ever he saw one: more like a skinned rabbit than a woman, and a regular gabble-grinder into the bargain. It was a marvel to him that Miss Wychwood was able to endure her bibble-babble, for she wasn't short of a sheet, not by any means she wasn't!</p> <p>The lady thus stigmatized was seated beside Miss Wychwood in the carriage, beguiling the tedium of the journey with a stream of small talk. She was of uncertain age, but it was unkind to describe her as an old Tough; and although she was certainly very thin it was unjust to liken her to a skinned rabbit. She was a distant relation of Miss Wychwood, left by an improvident parent in indigent circumstances; and when she had received a visit from Sir Geoffrey Wychwood, and had grasped that she owed this unprecedented honour to his urgent wish to procure her services as chaperon to his sister she had seen in his unromantically stout person a Paladin sent by Providence to rescue her from a drab lodging, mean fare, and the constant dread of finding herself in debt. She was not to know that her prospective charge had fought strenuously against having her, or any other female, foisted on to her; but when she had presented herself at Twynham Park, nervously clutching her oldfashioned reticule, desperately anxious to please, and staring up into Miss Wychwood's face with frightened, pleading eyes, Miss Wychwood's heart had overcome her judgement, and she had had no other thought than to make the poor little creature welcome. Lady Wychwood, quite unable to picture meek little Miss Farlow as a companion, and far less as a chaperon, to the lively Miss Wychwood, took the earliest opportunity that offered to beg her sister-in-law not to accept Miss Farlow's services without careful consideration. &#x2018;I am persuaded, dearest, that you will find her a dreadful bore!' she said earnestly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, very likely, but I should find any chaperon a dreadful bore,' said Annis. &#x2018;So, if I must have a chaperon not that I see the least need of one, at my age! I'd as lief have her as any other. At least she won't try to rule my house, or to dictate to me! Besides, I'm sorry for her!' She laughed suddenly, perceiving the doubtful look in Lady Wychwood's mild blue eyes. &#x2018;Ah, you are afraid she won't exercise any control over me! You are perfectly right: she won't! But nor would anyone else, you know.'</p> <p>&#x2018;But, Annis, Geoffrey says '</p> <p>&#x2018;I know exactly what Geoffrey says,' interrupted Annis. &#x2018;I've known what he would say any time these twenty years, and I find him far more of a bore than poor Maria Farlow. No, no, don't try to look shocked! I daresay no one knows better than you that he and I cannot deal together. The only time when we have been in perfect agreement was when he assured me that I should love his wife!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, Annis!' protested Lady Wychwood, blushing, and turning away her head. &#x2018;You shouldn't say such things! Besides, I can't believe you mean it, when you won't continue living with me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What a rapper!' commented Annis, the laughter still dancing in her eyes. &#x2018;I could live happily with you for the rest of my days, as well you know! It's my very worthy, starched-up, and consequential brother with whom I can't and won't live. Yes, isn't it unnatural of me?'</p> <p>&#x2018;So sad!' mourned her ladyship.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no, why? You would have cause to say so if I did remain here. You must surely own that life would be very much more peaceful without me provoking Geoffrey a dozen times a day!'</p> <p>Lady Wychwood did not deny this, but she sighed and said: &#x2018;But you are far too young to be setting up your own establish-ment, dearest! I quite agree with dear Geoffrey about that!'</p> <p>&#x2018;You always do agree with him, Amabel: indeed, you are the perfect wife for him!' interjected Annis irrepressibly.</p> <p>&#x2018;I am sure I'm no such thing, though I do try to be. And as for agreeing with him, gentlemen are so much wiser than we are, and so much better able to judge of of worldly matters don't you think?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Emphatically, No!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But indeed Geoffrey is right when he says it will present a very odd appearance if you go to live in Bath all by yourself!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I shan't be all by myself, for I shall have Maria Farlow with me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Annis, I cannot persuade myself that she is the right person for you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but the beauty of it is that having chosen her, and foisted her on to me, Geoffrey will never acknowledge that he was in error. Depend upon it, he will soon be discovering all manner of virtues in her, and telling you that her meek disposition will have an excellent influence over me.'</p> <p>Since Sir Geoffrey had already said something very like this to her, Lady Wychwood was obliged to laugh; but she shook her head as well, and said: &#x2018;It's all very well for you to turn everything to a joke, but it won't be funny for Geoffrey or for me either! when we have people thinking that you left home because we were unkind to you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;My dear, they won't think any such thing when they see that we are on terms of perfect amity. I hope you don't mean to cut my acquaintance? I expect to entertain you frequently in Camden Place, and give you fair warning that I shall always look on Twynham as my second home, and am likely to descend upon you without ceremony for long visits. You will be wishing me at Jericho, I daresay!' She saw that Lady Wychwood was looking melancholy still, and went to sit beside her, taking her hand, and saying: &#x2018;Try to understand, Amabel! It isn't only because Geoffrey and I rub against one another that I am going to set up a home for myself. I want I want a life of my own!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I do understand that!' said Lady Wychwood, in quick sympathy. &#x2018;From the moment I set eyes on you I have felt that it was positively wicked that such a lovely girl as you should be wasting her life! If only you would accept Lord Beckenham's offer, or Mr Kilbride's well, no, perhaps not his! Geoffrey says he's a here-and-thereian, and a gamester, and I suppose that would hardly do for you, though I must confess that I thought he was excessively charming! Well, if you couldn't like Beckenham, what did you find to dislike in young Gaydon? Or '</p> <p>&#x2018;Stop, stop!' begged Annis laughingly. &#x2018;I found nothing to dis-like in any of them, but I couldn't discover in myself the smallest wish to marry any of them either. Indeed, I haven't any wish to marry anyone at all.'</p> <p>&#x2018;But, Annis, every woman must wish to be married!' cried Lady Wychwood, quite shocked.</p> <p>&#x2018;Now that provides the answer to what people will think when they see me living in my own house instead of at Twynham!' exclaimed Annis. &#x2018;They will think me an Eccentric! Ten to one, I shall become one of the Sights of Bath, like old General Preston or that weird creature who goes about in a hoop, and feathers! I shall be pointed out as '</p> <p>&#x2018;If you don't stop talking such nonsense I shall be strongly tempted to slap you!' interrupted Lady Wychwood. &#x2018;I don't doubt you'll be pointed out, but it won't be as an Eccentric!'</p> <p>In the event, both were proved to be right. Annis had acquaintances amongst the Bath residents, and several close friends living in the vicinity of Bath, with whom she had frequently stayed, so that she did not come to Bath as a stranger. It was thought to be a trifle eccentric of her to leave the shelter of her brother's house, but she was well-known to be a very independent young woman, and as she was, at that date, six and twenty years of age, long past her girlhood, only the stiffest and most censorious persons saw anything to condemn in her conduct. She was possessed of a considerable independence, and it was not to be wondered at that she should avail herself of its advantages. The only wonder was that she hadn't been snapped up in her first London Season by some gentleman on the look out for a bride in whom birth and beauty were accompanied by a handsome fortune.</p> <p>No one knew the size of her fortune, but it was obviously large: her family had owned Twynham Park for generations; and her beauty was remarkable. If there were those who considered her too tall, and others who could only see beauty in brunettes, these critics were few in number. Her admirers and she had a host of them declared her to be a piece of perfection, and from the top of her guinea-gold curls to the soles of her slender feet they could detect no flaw in her. Her eyes were particularly fine, being of a deep blue, and so full of light that one infatuated gentleman, of a poetic turn of mind, said that their brilliance put the stars to shame. They were smiling eyes, set under delicate, arched brows; and her generous mouth seemed to be made for laughter. For the rest, she had an elegant figure, moved gracefully, dressed herself with exquisite taste, and had charming manners, which endeared her to such elderly sticklers as old Mrs Mandeville, who pronounced her to be &#x2018;a very nice gal: none of your simpering misses! I can't think why she ain't married!'</p> <p>Those who had been acquainted with her father knew that he had been dotingly fond of her, and supposed that that might have been why she had accepted none of the offers made her. No doubt, said the wiseacres, that was also why she had come to live in Bath now that he was dead: she meant to marry at last, and what chance of meeting an eligible gentleman could there be in the wilds of the country? Only one lady saw any impropriety in it, and as she was notoriously spiteful, and had two rather plain daughters of marriageable age on her hands, no one paid any heed to her. Besides, Miss Wychwood had an elderly cousin living with her, and what could be more proper than that?</p> <p>So Sir Geoffrey was right too, and was able to plume himself on his wisdom. He very soon became reconciled to the situation, and found himself more in charity with his sister than he had ever been before. As for Miss Farlow, she had never been so happy in all her life, or enjoyed so much comfort, and she felt that she could never be sufficiently grateful to dear Annis, who not only paid her a very generous wage, but who showered every sort of luxury on her, from a fire in her bedroom to the right to order the carriage whenever she wished to go beyond walking-distance. Not that she ever did avail herself of this permission, for that, in her opinion, would be a sadly encroaching thing to do. Unfortunately, her overflowing gratitude caused her to irritate Miss Wychwood almost beyond bearing by fussing over her incessantly, running quite unnecessary errands for her (much to the jealous wrath of Miss Jurby, Annis's devoted dresser), and entertaining her (she hoped) with an inexhaustible flow of what Annis called nothing-sayings.</p> <p>She was doing that on the journey back to Bath from Twynham Park. The fact that she received only mechanical responses from Miss Wychwood did not offend her, or cause her to abate her cheerful chatter. Rather she increased it, for she could see that her dear Miss Wychwood was a trifle in the dumps, and considered it to be her duty to divert her mind. No doubt she was sad to be leaving Twynham: Miss Farlow could well understand that, for she was feeling rather sad herself: it had been such an agreeable week!</p> <p>&#x2018;So very kind as Lady Wychwood is!' she said brightly. &#x2018;I declare it makes one sorry to be going away, not but what home is best, isn't it? We must look forward now to Easter, when we shall have them all to stay in Camden Place. We shan't know how to make enough of those sweet children, shall we, Annis?'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't think I shall find it difficult,' said Annis, with a faint smile. &#x2018;And I fancy Jurby won't either!' she added, twinkling across at her dresser, who was sitting on the forward seat, holding her mistress's jewel-box on her angular knees. &#x2018;Little Tom's last encounter with Jurby was a very near-run thing, I promise you, Maria! Indeed, I am persuaded that had I not chanced to come into the room at that moment she'd have spanked him as well he deserved! Wouldn't you, Jurby?'</p> <p>Her dresser replied austerely: &#x2018;Tempted I may have been, Miss Annis, but the Lord gave me strength to resist the promptings of the Evil One.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no, was it the Lord who gave you that strength?' said Annis, quizzing her. &#x2018;I had thought it was my intervention that saved him!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor little fellow!' said Miss Farlow charitably. &#x2018;So high-spirited! Such quaint things as he says! I'm sure I never saw such a forward child. Your sweet little goddaughter, too, Annis!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I fear it's useless to ask me to go into raptures over infants in arms,' said Annis apologetically. &#x2018;I daresay I shall like both children well enough when they are older. In the meantime I must leave it to their mama, and to you, to dote on them.'</p> <p>Miss Farlow realized that dear Annis had the headache, which was the only possible explanation for her want of enthusiasm over her nephew and niece. She said: &#x2018;Now, why do you let me rattle on when I am persuaded you have the headache? That is not treating me as you should, or as I wish you to! There is nothing so irritating to the nerves as being obliged to attend to fireside chatter not that this is the fireside, of course, though the hot brick I have under my feet keeps me as warm as toast when one is not feeling in good point. And it wouldn't surprise me, my love, if it is the weather which has made your head ache, for a cold wind frequently gives me a sort of tic, and the wind is very sharp today not that we are conscious of it in the carriage, which I am sure is the most comfortable one imaginable, but there is bound to be a draught, and we mustn't forget that you stood talking to Sir Geoffrey for several minutes before you got into it. That was what started the mischief depend upon it! I expect it will go off when you are safely home again, and in the meantime I shan't tease you by talking to you. Are you sure you are warm enough? Let me give you my shawl, to put round your head! Jurby will hold your hat, or I will. Now, where did I put my smelling-salts? They should be in my reticule, for I always put them there when I go on a journey, because one never knows when one may need them, does one? But they don't seem to be Oh, yes, here they are! They had slipped down to the bottom, and were under my handkerchief, though goodness knows how they can have got under it, for I distinctly recall putting them on top of everything else, so that they would be handy. I often think how extraordinary it is that things move by themselves, which no one can deny they do!'</p> <p>She continued in this way for several minutes, and when Annis declined the shawl and the smelling-salts, wished that they had thought to bring a pillow to put behind Annis's head, or that it were possible to make her a tis...</p></p><h2>Jayhawker</h2><p>UNDERCOVER IN THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES<p></p><p></p><p>With the United States on the verge of civil war, Elijah Tully and his father ride out of Kansas as Jayhawkers, guerrilla fighters against slavery. After his father is killed, Lije goes undercover among the proslavery bushwhackers. Swept into a grisly raid, Lije unexpectedly stands face-to-face with his father's killer -- but is vengeance as simple as he once thought?</p></p><p><p>Patricia Beatty was born in Portland, Oregon, and was a longtime resident of southern California. After graduating from college, she taught high school English and history, and later held various positions as a science and technical librarian and also as a children's librarian. She taught Writing Fiction for Children at several branches of the University of California.</p><p>Patricia Beatty is the author of many popular and award-winning children's books, including such NCSS Notable Children's Trade Books in the Field of Social Studies as<em> Eight Mules from Monterey; Behave Yourself, Bethany Brant; Turn Homeward, Hannalee; Be Ever Hopeful, Hannalee; and Jayhawker.</em> Her novel <em>Lupita Ma�ana</em> is a Jane Addams Children's Book Award honor book, and <em>Charley Skedaddle</em> won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.</p>Grade 5-8-- To 13-year-old Elija "Lije" Tulley, the fanatical abolitionist John Brown is a hero in a righteous cause. He eagerly joins the band of men recruited by Brown to be Jayhawkers, Kansans who cross into neighboring Missouri to steal away slaves and help them to freedom. The Jayhawkers and their pro-slavery counterparts, the bushwhackers, clash often in bloody, sometimes murderous shootouts. In one such confrontation, Lije's father is killed, and Lije is recruited to live among a group of pro-slavery activitists as a spy. He learns about the quasi-soldiers led by Charles Quantrill, a cruel and unsavory character, and he meets Frank James and his brother Jesse. The story reaches its climax as Quantrill's forces attack and burn Lawrence, Kansas, where Lije's family lives. The unquestionable star of this story is Lije, a thoroughly believable boy caught up in events beyond his control but wanting to do his part for a cause in which he believes. The historical figures who populate the story are equally well portrayed; they appear as flesh-and-blood characters, not just names out of a history book. Another strength of this novel is that it tells a fast-paced suspenseful story while presenting a clear picture of a crucial period in U. S. history. The violence is not overplayed, nor is the abolitionist side portrayed as totally good. There is one glaring error in the text. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 did not free all slaves in the United States, as the story says, but only those in states in rebellion against the Union. Other than this, the book is a solid piece of historical fiction that's sure to have strong appeal. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Native American Crafts &amp; Skills</h2><p>An excellent introduction to the study of Native American crafts and outdoor skills.</p><p>Native American Crafts and Skills is an excellent introduction to the study of Native American crafts and outdoor skills.

By the author of Visions: Stories about Women Artists.</p><p>Leslie Sills is a sculptor whose work has been shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and other museums and galleries throughout the country. She has lectured on art and writing at museums, art schools, universities, colleges, and public schools. Her highly acclaimed books include "'Inspirations: Stories about Women Artists"', and ALA Notable Book for Children and a Booklist Editor's Choice' and "'Visions: Stories about Women Artists"', an ALA Notable Book for Children, a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and a Booklist Editor's Choice. Her website is www.lesliesills.com, and she lives in Brookline, Massachusetts. <br>Sills's (Inspirations: Stories About Women Artists) eye-opening introduction to a half-dozen strong, often pioneering women photographers focuses on how their lives, experiences and imaginations influenced their work. At the beginning of the century, Imogen Cunningham (1883-1976) staged deliberate and stylized compositions that proved photographs could not only record real life but also "be an artist's creation." (O'Keeffe fans can't help but notice the similarity between Cunningham's photograph Magnolia Blossom, 1925 and the painter's close-ups of flowers; the two artists were contemporaries.) Dorothea Lange's (1895-1965) photographs, on the other hand, were deemed "documentary." Her work chronicling Dust Bowl casualties and the plight of sharecroppers during the Depression precipitated government relief in the form of food and improved living facilities. Lola Alvarez Bravo (1907-1993) wanted her work to lovingly "stand for a Mexico that once existed," as she photographed a post-revolution Mexico. She acknowledges a debt to her painter friends, such as Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Jos Clemente Orozco (who taught her about light, composition, etc.). For the three modern photographers included, Sills offers much less biographical information and therefore readers may feel more distanced from them. Still, she makes a strong case for the contributions of Carrie Mae Weems, perhaps best known for a series of photos that takes a critical look at the way U.S. culture views African Americans in "American Icons" (1988-1989); and of Elsa Dorfman, whose friendship with the Beat poets inspired her to record "everyday life." In perhaps the most accessible example for young readers, Sills makes the connection between Cindy Sherman's childhood love for playacting and dress-up, and her famous staged self-portraits, each of which hint at a mysterious story. Supported throughout by well-chosen selections of each woman's work, this attractive volume may inspire a new generation to take up the camera. Ages 10-up.

The ex-spy has had a rough few years since British intelligence first turned on him and forced him to go into hiding. He&#39;s drinking again, forgetting things-getting soft. He hasn&#39;t even noticed the tap on his phone. Though Charlie doesn&#39;t know it yet, the walls are closing in again. He takes a job for his only friend, Rupert Willoughby, who sends Charlie to Rome to check the security system for some valuable jewels. Charlie has chosen the wrong time to visit the Eternal City. There&#39;s a mole in the British embassy there, and the agents of the East and West are homing in fast. Charlie, unlucky as always, is about to find himself caught between a very solid rock and an equally hard place.</p><p><p>Brian Freemantle [b. 1936] is one of Britain's most acclaimed authors of spy fiction. His novels have sold over ten million copies worldwide. Born in Southampton, Freemantle entered his career as a journalist, and began writing espionage thrillers in the late 1960s. Charlie M (1977) introduced the world to Charlie Muffin and won Freemantle international recognition&#x2014;he would go on to publish fourteen titles in the series.&nbsp;<br><br>Freemantle has written dozens of other novels, including two featuring Sebastian Holmes, an illegitimate son of Sherlock Holmes, and the Cowley and Danilov series, about an American FBI agent and a Russian militia detective who work together to comabt organized crime in the post-Cold War world. Freemantle lives and works in London, England.</p>Within the very first chapter, the listener becomes fond, even protective, of Charlie Muffin, hard-drinking British ex-secret agent. Hired by an insurance company to protect the jewelry of the British ambassador's wife in Italy, Charlie goes to Rome. At the same time, his former intelligence service determines that the embassy in Rome has a mole. Unbeknownst to him, Charlie is chosen by both the KGB and MI6 to be the patsy. Narrator Hayward Morse has many voices--all of them consistent, most of them appealing. Even the female characters sound authentic. The listener never loses track of who is speaking, which is important, as most of the action in the book is conveyed by dialogue.

From fast-growing denominations such as the Assemblies of God to popular television ministries such as "The 700 Club," the fruits of Pentecostalism can be seen throughout modern Christian life.<p>In this landmark study, Dr. Dayton explains how Pentecostalism grew out of Methodism and the nineteenth-century holiness revivals. He finds evidence of Wesleyan teaching in the classic writings of many Pentecostal leaders. He shows how Pentecostalism is rooted in the Wesleyan theological tradition, rather than being a contrived system of modern revivalistic ides. Martin E. Marty says in his foreword that Pentecostals "have no choice, it is clear from this book, but to see that there were . . . roots to the growth they reaped." He calls <i>Theological Roots of Pentecostalism</i> "a very important statement . . . one without which subsequent commentators on Pentecostalism are not likely to give intelligent accounts."</p></p><p>Donald W.

A brilliant lawyer and orator, a famous wit and philosopher, he launched himself at the age of twenty-seven into the violent, treacherous world of Roman politics. Cicero was determined to attain imperium, the supreme power in the state. Beside him at all times in his struggle to reach the top &#x2014; the office of Consul &#x2014; was his confidential secretary, Tiro. An accomplished man, Tiro was the inventor of shorthand and the author of numerous books, including a famous life of Cicero, unfortunately lost in the Dark Ages.<br><br>In Imperium, Robert Harris recreates Tiro&#x2019;s vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero&#x2019;s rise to power, from radical young lawyer to first citizen of Rome, competing with men such as Pompey, Caesar, Crassus and Cato. <br><br>Harris&#x2019;s Cicero is an immensely sympathetic figure.

After Cicero's tactical masterstroke on that first day, Verres and his advocates resembled nothing so much as the victims of a siege: holed up in their little fortress, surrounded by their enemies, battered day after day by a rain of missiles, and their crumbling walls undermined by tunnels. They had no means of fighting back. Their only hope was somehow to withstand the onslaught for the nine days remaining, and then try to regroup during the lull enforced by Pompey's games. Cicero's objective was equally clear: to obliterate Verres's defenses so completely that by the time he had finished laying out his case, not even the most corrupt senatorial jury in Rome would dare to acquit him. </p><p> He set about this mission with his usual discipline. The prosecution team would gather before dawn. While Cicero performed his exercises, was shaved and dressed, I would read out the testimony of the witnesses he would be calling that day and run through our schedule of evidence. He would then dictate to me the rough outline of what he intended to say. For an hour or two he would familiarize himself with the day's brief and thoroughly memorize his remarks, while Quintus, Frugi, and I ensured that all his witnesses and evidence boxes were ready. We would then parade down the hill to the Forum -- and parades they were, for the general view around Rome was that Cicero's performance in the extortion court was the greatest show in town. The crowds were as large on the second and third days as they had been on the first, and the witnesses' performances were often heartbreaking, as they collapsed in tears recounting their ill treatment. I remember in particular Dio of Halaesa, swindled out of ten thousand sesterces, and two brothers from Agyrium forced to hand over their entire inheritance of four thousand. There would have been more, but Lucius Metellus had actually refused to let a dozen witnesses leave the island to testify, among them the chief priest of Jupiter, Heraclius of Syracuse -- an outrage against justice which Cicero neatly turned to his advantage. "Our allies' rights," he boomed, "do not even include permission to complain of their sufferings!" Throughout all this, Hortensius, amazing to relate, never said a word. Cicero would finish his examination of a witness, Glabrio would offer the King of the Law Courts his chance to cross-examine, and His Majesty would regally shake his head, or declare grandly, "No questions for this witness." On the fourth day, Verres pleaded illness and tried to be excused from attending, but Glabrio was having none of it, and told him he would be carried down to the Forum on his bed if necessary. </p><p> It was on the following afternoon that Cicero's cousin Lucius at last returned to Rome, his mission in Sicily accomplished. Cicero was overjoyed to find him waiting at the house when we got back from court, and he embraced him tearfully. Without Lucius's support in dispatching witnesses and boxes of evidence back to the mainland, Cicero's case would not have been half as strong. But the seven-month effort had clearly exhausted Lucius, who had not been a strong man to begin with. He was now alarmingly thin and had developed a painful, racking cough. Even so, his commitment to bringing Verres to justice was unwavering -- so much so that he had missed the opening of the trial in order to take a detour on his journey back to Rome. He had stayed in Puteoli and tracked down two more witnesses: the Roman knight, Gaius Numitorius, who had witnessed the crucifixion of Gavius in Messana; and a friend of his, a merchant named Marcus Annius, who had been in Syracuse when the Roman banker Herennius had been judicially murdered. </p><p> "And where are these gentlemen?" asked Cicero eagerly. </p><p> "Here," replied Lucius. "In the tablinum. But I must warn you, they do not want to testify." </p><p> Cicero hurried through to find two formidable men of middle age -- "the perfect witnesses from my point of view," as Cicero afterwards described them, "prosperous, respectable, sober, and above all -- not Sicilian." As Lucius had predicted, they were reluctant to get involved. They were businessmen, with no desire to make powerful enemies, and did not relish the prospect of taking starring roles in Cicero's great anti-aristocratic production in the Roman Forum. But he wore them down, for they were not fools, either, and could see that in the ledger of profit and loss, they stood to gain most by aligning themselves with the side that was winning. "Do you remember what Pompey said to Sulla, when the old man tried to deny him a triumph on his twenty-sixth birthday?" asked Cicero. "He told me over dinner the other night: 'More people worship a rising than a setting sun.'" This potent combination of name-dropping and appeals to patriotism and self-interest at last brought them around, and by the time they went in to dinner with Cicero and his family they had pledged their support. </p><p> "I knew if I had them in your company for a few moments," whispered Lucius, "they would do whatever you wanted." </p><p> I had expected Cicero to put them on the witness stand the very next day, but he was too smart for that. "A show must always end with a climax," he said. He was ratcheting up the level of outrage with each new piece of evidence, having moved on through judicial corruption, extortion, and straightforward robbery to cruel and unusual punishment. On the eighth day of the trial, he dealt with the testimony of two Sicilian naval captains, Phalacrus of Centuripae and Onasus of Segesta, who described how they and their men had escaped floggings and executions by bribing Verres's freedman Timarchides (present in court, I am glad to say, to experience his humiliation personally). Worse: the families of those who had not been able to raise sufficient funds to secure the release of their relatives had been told they would still have to pay a bribe to the official executioner, Sextius, or he would deliberately make a mess of the beheadings. "Think of that unbearable burden of pain," declaimed Cicero, "of the anguish that racked those unhappy parents, thus compelled to purchase for their children by bribery not life but a speedy death!" I could see the senators on the jury shaking their heads at this and muttering to one another, and each time Glabrio invited Hortensius to cross-examine the witnesses, and Hortensius simply responded yet again, "No questions," they groaned. Their position was becoming intolerable, and that night the first rumors reached us that Verres had already packed up the contents of his house and was preparing to flee into exile. </p><p> Such was the state of affairs on the ninth day, when we brought Annius and Numitorius into court. If anything, the crowd in the Forum was bigger than ever, for there were now only two days left until Pompey's great games. Verres came late and obviously drunk. He stumbled as he climbed the steps of the temple up to the tribunal, and Hortensius had to steady him as the crowd roared with laughter. As he passed Cicero's place, he flashed him a shattered, red-eyed look of fear and rage -- the hunted, cornered look of an animal: the Boar at bay. Cicero got straight down to business and called as his first witness Annius, who described how he had been inspecting a cargo down at the harbor in Syracuse one morning when a friend had come running to tell him that their business associate, Herennius, was in chains in the forum and pleading for his life. </p><p> "So what did you do?" </p><p> "Naturally, I went at once." </p><p> "And what was the scene?" </p><p> "There were perhaps a hundred people crying out that Herennius was a Roman citizen and could not be executed without a proper trial." </p><p> "How did you all know that Herennius was a Roman? Was he not a banker from Spain?" </p><p> "Many of us knew him personally. Although he had business in Spain, he had been born to a Roman family in Syracuse and had grown up in the city." </p><p> "And what was Verres's response to your pleas?" </p><p> "He ordered Herennius to be beheaded immediately." </p><p> There was a groan of horror around the court. </p><p> "And who dealt the fatal blow?" </p><p> "The public executioner, Sextius." </p><p> "And did he make a clean job of it?" </p><p> "I am afraid he did not, no." </p><p> "Clearly," said Cicero, turning to the jury, "he had not paid Verres and his gang of thieves a large enough bribe." </p><p> For most of the trial, Verres had sat slumped in his chair, but on this morning, fired by drink, he jumped up and began shouting that he had never taken any such bribe. Hortensius had to pull him down. Cicero ignored him and went on calmly questioning his witness. </p><p> "This is an extraordinary situation, is it not? A hundred of you vouch for the identity of this Roman citizen, yet Verres does not even wait an hour to establish the truth of who he is. How do you account for it?" </p><p> "I can account for it easily, senator. Herennius was a passenger on a ship from Spain that was impounded with all its cargo by Verres's agents. He was sent to the Stone Quarries, along with everyone else on board, then dragged out to be publicly executed as a pirate. What Verres did not realize was that Herennius was not from Spain at all. He was known to the Roman community in Syracuse and would be recognized. But by the time Verres discovered his mistake, Herennius could not be allowed to go free, because he knew too much about what the governor was up to." </p><p> "Forgive me, I do not understand," said Cicero, playing the innocent. "Why would Verres want to execute an innocent passenger on a cargo ship as a pirate?" </p><p> "He needed to show a sufficient number of executions." </p><p> "Why?" </p><p> "Because he was being paid bribes to let the real pirates go free." </p><p> Verres was on his feet again shouting that it was a lie, and this time Cicero took a few paces toward him. "A lie, you monster? A lie? Then why in your own prison records does it state that Herennius was released? And why do they further state that the notorious pirate captain Heracleo was executed, when no one on the ...</p></p><h2>Survival (Usborne True Stories)</h2><p>Recounts how some of the passengers on the Hindenburg, Captain Bligh after the mutiny, Antoine de Saint-Exup�ery, the crew of the Apollo 13, and other travelers have survived great dangers on their journeys.</p><p></p><h2>Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Written in response to the controversy surrounding &#34;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin,&#34; &#34;Dred&#34; provides an even stronger indictment of slavery through the stories of Nina Gordon, a mistress of a slave plantation, and Dred, an African American revolutionary.</p><p>"Provides another opportunity for scholars and students to learn how Stowe craft[ed] a second and even more radical novel. . . .

It seems Carmella's estranged sister Alta has been murdered, but no one in New York City seems to care. Why? Alta, a FDNY EMT, and her partner had months earlier refused to give assistance to a dying man at a fancy downtown eatery. Moe decides to help Carmella as a means to distract himself from his own life-and-death struggle. Making headway on the case is no mean feat as no one, including Alta's partner Maya Watson, wants to cooperate. Moe chips away until he discovers a cancer roiling just below the surface, a cancer whose symptoms include bureaucratic greed, sexual harassment, and blackmail. But is any of it connected to Alta's brutal murder?</p></p><p><p><b> Amazon Exclusive Essay: <em>Quintessential Moe</em> by Reed Farrel Coleman</b></p> <p> The Moe Prager Mystery series stands on two fundemental building blocks. One of those blocks comes courtesy of the great William Faulkner who said, "The past is never dead. It isn't even past." The other comes from Joseph Wambaugh, the man who, in the 1970s, changed crime fiction forever and for better. He said, "It's not how the detective works on the case, but how the case works on the detective."</p> <p> In each book in the series, these are the two forces supplying the fuel to power the engine of the story. This is never more evident than in <em>Hurt Machine</em>, the seventh installment in the series. Moe, now in his mid-sixties, is faced with the best and worst life has to offer. His daughter Sarah, Moe's only child with his late wife Katy, is on the verge of marriage. Yet two weeks before the wedding, he discovers that there's a cancer growing in his stomach that will probably kill him. Add to this the arrival--after a painful divorce and a ten-year absence--of Moe's second wife and former PI partner, Carmella Melendez, asking him to take on a controversial and wildly unpopular case. If ever there was a setup to explore the past and to see how a case works on the detective, this is it.</p> Moe is forced to battle two antagonists in <em>Hurt Machine</em>: the person or persons trying to prevent him from discovering the truth about the case and the cancer. All the time, Moe can hear the clock ticking away the remaining minutes of his life. When the end is near, the past comes alive in a way it never has before. So it is for Moe.Reed Farrel Coleman is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author that has been called a "hard-boiled poet" by NPR's Maureen Corrigan and the "noir poet laureate" in <i>The </i><i>Huffington Post</i>.

Despite a tendency toward propaganda, Ginsberg&#39;s best poetry is infused with satiric comedy and cheerful self-parody, and is most readily appreciated when read aloud.<p>Allen Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry.

I would if I was your age. Quicker than sitting with this scum." </p><p> "I'll be all right," said Cork, the albino cypher clerk, and looked anxiously at the older man in the driving seat beside him. "We'll just have to hurry slowly," he added in his most conciliatory tone. Cork was a cockney, bright as paint, and it worried him to see Meadowes all het up. "We'll just have to let it happen to us, won't we, Arthur?" </p><p> "I'd like to throw the whole bloody lot of them in the Rhine." </p><p> "You know you wouldn't really." </p><p> It was Saturday morning, nine o'clock. The road from Friesdorf to the Embassy was packed tight with protesting cars, the pavements lined with photographs of the Movement's leader, and the banners were stretched across the road like advertisements at a rally: "The West has deceived us; Germans can look East without shame." "End the Coca-Cola culture now!" At the very centre of the long column sat Cork and Meadowes, becalmed while the clamour of horns rose all round them in unceasing concert. Sometimes they sounded in series starting at the front and working slowly back, so that their roar passed overhead like an aeroplane sometimes in unison, dash dot dash, K for Karfeld our elected leader; and sometimes they just had a free for all, tuning for the symphony. </p><p> "What the hell do they want with it then? All the screaming? Bloody good haircut, that's what half of them need, a good hiding and back to school." </p><p> "It's the farmers," Cork said, "I told you, they're picketing the Bundestag." </p><p> "Farmers? This lot? They'd die if they got their feet wet, half of them. Kids. Look at that crowd there then. Disgusting, that's what I call it." </p><p> To their right, in a red Volkswagen, sat three students, two boys and a girl. The driver wore a leather jacket and very long hair, and he was gazing intently through his windscreen at the car in front, his slim palm poised over the steering wheel, waiting for the signal to blow his horn. His two companions, intertwined, were kissing deeply. </p><p> "They're the supporting cast," Cork said. "It's a lark for them. You know the students' slogan: 'Freedom's only real when you're fighting for it.' It's not so different from what's going on at home, is it? Hear what they did in Grosvenor Square last night?" Cork asked, attempting once again to shift the ground. "If that's education, I'll stick to ignorance." </p><p> But Meadowes would not be distracted. </p><p> "They ought to bring in the National Service," he declared, glaring at the Volkswagen. "That would sort them out." </p><p> "They've got it already. They've had it twenty years or more." Sensing that Meadowes was preparing to relent, Cork chose the subject most likely to encourage him. "Here, how did Myra's birthday party go, then? Good show was it? I'll bet she had a lovely time." </p><p> But for some reason the question only cast Meadowes into even deeper gloom, and after that Cork chose silence as the wiser course. He had tried everything, and to no effect. Meadowes was a decent, churchy sort of bloke, the kind they didn't make any more, and worth a good deal of anybody's time; but there was a limit even to Cork's filial devotion. He'd tried the new Rover which Meadowes had bought for his retirement, tax free and at a ten per cent discount. He'd admired its build, its comfort and its fittings until he was blue in the face, and all he'd got for his trouble was a grunt. He'd tried the Exiles Motoring Club, of which Meadowes was a keen supporter; he'd tried the Commonwealth Children's Sports which they hoped to run that afternoon in the Embassy gardens. And now he had even tried last night's big party, which they hadn't liked to attend because of Janet's baby being so near; and as far as Cork was concerned, that was the whole menu and Meadowes could lump it. Short of a holiday, Cork decided, short of a long, sunny holiday away from Karfeld and the Brussels negotiations, and away from his daughter Myra, Arthur Meadowes was heading for the bend. </p><p> "Here," said Cork trying one more throw, "Dutch Shell's up another bob." </p><p> "And Guest Keen are down three." </p><p> Cork had resolutely invested in non-British stock, but Meadowes preferred to pay the price of patriotism. </p><p> "They'll go up again after Brussels, don't you worry." </p><p> "Who are you kidding? The talks are as good as dead aren't they? I may not have your intelligence but I can read, you know." </p><p> Meadowes, as Cork was the very first to concede, had every excuse for melancholy, quite apart from his investments in British steel. He'd come with hardly a break from four years in Warsaw which was enough to make anyone jumpy. He was on his last posting and facing retirement in the autumn, and in Cork's experience they got worse, not better, the nearer the day came. Not to mention having a nervous wreck for a daughter: Myra Meadowes was on the road to recovery, true enough, but if one half of what they said of her was to be believed, she'd got a long way to go yet. </p><p> Add to that the responsibilities of Chancery Registrar -- of handling, that is, a political archive in the hottest crisis any of them could remember -- and you had more than your work cut out. Even Cork, tucked away in Cyphers, had felt the draught a bit, what with the extra traffic, and the extra hours, and Janet's baby coming on, and the do-this-by-yesterday that you got from most of Chancery; and his own experience, as he well knew, was nothing beside what old Arthur had had to cope with. It was the coming from all directions, Cork decided, that threw you these days. You never knew where it would happen next. One minute you'd be getting off a Reply Immediate on the Bremen riots, or tomorrow's jamboree in Hanover, the next they'd be coming back at you with the gold rush, or Brussels, or raising another few hundred millions in Frankfurt and Zurich; and if it was tough in Cyphers, it was tougher still for those who had to track down the files, enter up the loose papers, mark in the new entries and get them back into circulation again...which reminded him, for some reason, that he must telephone his accountant. If the Krupp labour front was going on like this, he might take a little look at Swedish steel, just an in-and-outer for the baby's bank account... </p><p> "Hullo," said Cork brightening. "Going to have a scrap, are we?" </p><p> Two policemen had stepped off the kerb to remonstrate with a large agricultural man in a Mercedes Diesel. First he lowered the window and shouted at them; now he opened the door and shouted at them again. Quite suddenly, the police withdrew. Cork yawned in disappointment. </p><p> Once upon a time, Cork remembered wistfully, panics came singly. You had a scream on the Berlin corridor, Russian helicopters teasing up the border, an up-and-downer with the Four Power Steering Committee in Washington. Or there was intrigue: suspected German diplomatic initiative in Moscow that had to be nipped in the bud, a suspected fiddle on the Rhodesian embargo, hushing up a Rhine Army riot in Minden. And that was that. You bolted your food, opened shop, and stayed till the job was done; and you went home a free man. That was that; that was what life was made of; that was Bonn. Whether you were a dip like de Lisle, or a non-dip behind the green baize door, the scene was the same; a bit of drama, a lot of hot air, then tickle up the stocks and shares a bit, back to boredom and roll on your next posting. </p><p> Until Karfeld. Cork gazed disconsolately at the posters. Until Karfeld came along. Nine months, he reflected -- the vast features were plump and lifeless, the expression one of flatulent sincerity -- nine months since Arthur Meadowes had come bustling through the connecting door from Registry with the news of the Kiel demonstrations, the surprise nomination, the student sit-in, and the little bit of violence they had gradually learnt to expect. Who caught it that time? Some Socialist counter-demonstrators. One beaten to death, one stoned...it used to shock them in the old days. They were green then. Christ, he thought, it might have been ten years ago; but Cork could date it almost to the hour. </p><p> Kiel was the morning the Embassy doctor announced that Janet was expecting. From that day on, nothing had ever been the same. </p><p> The horns broke wildly into song again; the convoy jerked forward and stopped abruptly, clanging and screeching all different notes. </p><p> "Any luck with those files then?" Cork enquired, his mind lighting upon the suspected cause of Meadowes' anxiety. </p><p> "No." </p><p> "Trolley hasn't turned up?" </p><p> "No, the trolley has not turned up." </p><p> Ball-bearings, Cork thought suddenly: some nice little Swedish outfit with a get-up-and-go approach, a firm capable of moving in fast...two hundred quid's worth and away we all go... </p><p> "Come on Arthur, don't let it get you down. It's not Warsaw you know: you're in Bonn now. Look: know how many cups they're shy of in the canteen, just on the last six weeks alone? Not broken, mind, just lost: twenty-four." </p><p> Meadowes was unimpressed. </p><p> "Now who wants to pinch an Embassy cup? No one. People are absent-minded. They're <i>involved.</i> It's the crisis, see. It's happening everywhere. It's the same with files." </p><p> "Cups aren't secret, that's the difference." </p><p> "Nor's file trolleys," Cork pleaded, "if it comes to that. Nor's the two-bar electric fire from the conference room which Admin are doing their nut about. Nor's the long-carriage typewriter from the Pool, nor -- listen Arthur, <i>you</i> can't be blamed, not with so much going on; how can you? You know what dips are when they get to drafting telegrams. Look at de Lisle, look at Gaveston: dreamers. I'm not saying they aren't geniuses but they don't know where they are half the time, their heads are in the clouds. You can't be blamed for that." </p><p> "I <i>can</i> be blamed. I'm responsible." </p><p> "All right, torture yourself," Cork snapped, his last patience gone. "Anyway it's Bradfield's responsibility, not yours. He's Head of Chancery; he's responsible for security." </p><p> With this parting comment, Cork once more fell to surveying the unprep...</p></p><h2>The Book of Essie: A novel</h2><p><b>FINALIST FOR THE 2018 NEW ENGLAND BOOK AWARD<br><br>"Both timelessly beautiful and unbelievably timely."&#x2014;Chris Bohjalian, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>The Flight Attendant&nbsp;</i> <br><br>A captivating novel of family, fame, and religion that tells the story of the seventeen-year-old daughter of an evangelical preacher, star of the family's hit reality show, and the secret pregnancy that threatens to blow their entire world apart. <br></b><br>Esther Ann Hicks--Essie--is the youngest child on <i>Six for Hicks,</i> a reality television phenomenon.

She continues to live and work as a physician in the Boston area. This is her first novel.<p><b>Esther </b></p><p>On the day I turn seventeen, there is a meeting to decide whether I should have the baby or if sneaking me to a clinic for an abortion is worth the PR risk. I am not invited, which is just as well, since my being there might imply that I have some choice in the matter and I know that I have none. I listen in, though, the way Lissa and I used to before she went away. It was Lissa who discovered the vent in the wall of the laundry room, who realized that you could eavesdrop on everything that was said in the production office if you climbed onto the dryer and put your ear up against the filigreed bronze grate.</p><p>The winter Lissa broke her leg, she was fourteen and I was nine. I remember she chose an orange cast that Mother hated and the doctor laughed and said something about Lissa being a firecracker and Mother frowned but didn&#x2019;t dare to disagree, not with the cameras rolling. I could tell she was worried that the color was too bright, that it would bleed on-screen or at the very least be distracting. It lasted only a second, the withering look she shot my sister as the fiberglass was unwrapped and wound round and round the crack above Lissa&#x2019;s ankle. But even at nine, I was well versed in Mother&#x2019;s methods of wordless communication. I knew exactly what to look for, just as I knew to look for the ash of defiance in Lissa&#x2019;s eyes that was my sister&#x2019;s only reply.</p><p>The doctor signed the cast when he was done and so did all the nurses, then Lissa and I were given Popsicles for the ride home. They were orange, to match the cast, but Mother made us throw them in the trash as soon as we reached the parking lot. She said the sugar would ruin our teeth, but I think really she did it just to punish us, to remind Lissa that she shouldn&#x2019;t count on the cameras for protection, that they might delay the consequences of her actions but would never entirely prevent them. She needn&#x2019;t have bothered. It was the first lesson any of us learned.</p><p>That cast was the reason it became my job to climb up and report everything the grown-ups said, because Lissa couldn&#x2019;t do it herself without breaking the only good leg she had left. It&#x2019;s possible that without that orange cast, Lissa would never have told me about the vent at all, since trusting me was a risk. She might have kept the secret to herself, ferreting away this little piece of knowledge the way she used to hide the chocolate bars she stole from Stahl&#x2019;s Sweet Shoppe when she stopped in with Becca Twomey on their way home from school. Lissa never bought anything, but Becca was allowed to spend her allowance on whatever she wanted; in any case, that was how it seemed.</p><p>Lissa and I, on the other hand, were allowed chocolate only on birthdays and Easter. I always wondered, after she was gone and I found the box of unopened candy under her bed, why she bothered to steal it at all, why she took such a chance. If she had been found out, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been only Daddy&#x2019;s paddle she&#x2019;d have had to contend with. Mother&#x2019;s silent punishment would have been much worse. It meant something, I realized, that Lissa could sneak the Milky Ways into her bag without Mr. Stahl noticing yet never bring herself to open them. Eating the chocolate, I saw much later on, would have been the thing that made the stealing real.</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p>The dryer is running and slightly warm when I sit on it. It&#x2019;s a pleasant sensation, but the clang of some sort of metal clip getting thwapped against the drum covers up the sound of the producer speaking on the other side of the wall, so I turn the dryer off. Once the drum has stopped turning, I can hear well enough to make out what Candy is saying. The name fits her. Sweet as sugar but hard enough to break a tooth on. She has been with us since before I was born, since that first Christmas special when Matty was not quite three and my parents had just been told that there would be no more children.</p><p>Daddy had spent so much time on television by then you&#x2019;d have thought it would have come naturally, but Mother said he was as nervous as a pig in a bacon factory the day the new crew started filming. Up until then, the cameras had only been at church, where they were entirely under Daddy&#x2019;s control. Could he tell then that the balance of power was subtly shifting? In any case, Mother had to force Daddy to let the crew into the house and even then he did this thing where he scratched his wrist incessantly anytime the cameras were pointed at him. Candy&#x2019;s team did their best to edit this out, to use the close-ups of his pensive expression and his clear blue eyes, but there are a few shots where you can see him moving his fingers back and forth compulsively, as if possessed, like an addict scratching at invisible bugs burrowing just beneath his skin.</p><p>Mother stole the show, though, so it didn&#x2019;t matter. She cried real tears when she revealed their struggles to conceive, their disappointment. She was candid when she confessed that they had always wanted a big family, a brood, a flock to tend and raise up in His grace and light. After all, if children are a gift from God, surely Daddy was deserving of more than just a single blessing since he had made it his life&#x2019;s work to speak His truth and praise His name even in these darkest days. She sighed and reached out and took my father&#x2019;s hand then, stilled it, and held it tight to keep him from scratching. With her eyes turned up to the ceiling, the tears welled at first but did not fall. Then Mother looked directly at the camera and breathed something about accepting God&#x2019;s will and those fat drops rolled right down her tastefully rouged cheeks as if she had control over gravity itself.</p><p>That hour-long special probably would have just been a one-off since Daddy said the focus should be on his ministry, not on his family, but on Christmas Eve they found out that Daniel was on the way and people called it an honest-to-God miracle and there was no stopping after that. Nine months later when my brother was born, ten million people tuned in to see it happen. Not the actual moment, of course, but everything leading up to it: the praying, the hand-holding, the reciting of bits of verse. Then he was lifted, slick and shrieking and still streaked with blood, and Daddy let loose a heartfelt alleluia and a regular television phenomenon was born.</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p>On the other side of the wall I hear Candy say, &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>To her credit, there is no judgment in her tone&#x2014;none that I can detect, in any case. Her face might be an entirely different matter, but I cannot see it. I can imagine, though, the near silent signs of disapproval: the slightly downturned lip, the light tap of a perfectly manicured nail on the polished wood surface of the table. Candy has no children, after all. We are all the family she&#x2019;s got. It&#x2019;s possible that this feels personal, though I doubt she would ever admit it.</p><p>&#x201c;I watched her repeat the test myself.&#x201d;</p><p>This is my mother&#x2019;s voice, smooth and velvety and utterly composed. You would think she was discussing which muffin recipe she might bake for an upcoming church fair, parsing the relative merits of currants and pumpkin spice. She almost sounds bored. The words fall evenly from her lips, with a hint of a drawl that I recognize as an affectation. Like her modest light blue suit and single strand of pearls, this voice is something that has been carefully chosen; cultivated, even. The vocal coach comes once a week on Tuesday mornings and stops by on an as-needed basis to deliver special lozenges if Mother&#x2019;s throat is sore, which is more often than you would expect. She is forever sipping tea with honey and telling people how exhausting it is, running the household all by herself since Daddy has to conserve his energies for more elevated pursuits. Except she doesn&#x2019;t really run the household; Candy does. But no one would ever dare tell Mother that.</p><p>In the early days, when it was just Daddy&#x2019;s church services that were being broadcast and before Mother herself was properly a star, they used a voice double for close-ups of Mother standing in the front row during hymns. As the voices of the congregation swelled behind her, Mother would hold her hymnal open at her waist, never looking down at the page but instead keeping her eyes glued to the stained glass window above and behind the altar. She had each and every song in that book memorized, knew even the page numbers by heart. The organist would play a few bars of introduction and then Mother&#x2019;s mouth would open and shut in rhythm with the music, soundlessly I knew, but it looked for all the world like she was really singing, as if the music itself had her in its thrall.</p><p>Then the camera would zoom in even closer and in the version that TIL would broadcast, one voice would be heard rising above the others, a voice like an angel&#x2019;s, or so Daddy liked to tell his parishioners during coffee hour. This sort of compliment always made Mother blush demurely and shake her head so that the gaggle of old women who followed Daddy around at events like this would transition directly from talking about Mother&#x2019;s voice to remarking upon how modest she was. No one knew that the voice was not really hers, that it belonged to a music teacher in Cincinnati named Tracey Goldberg. No one knew that Tracey, raising three children all on her own after her husband skipped town with a waitress from Des Moines, had not even read the non- disclosure agreement Candy had handed her, had not stopped to think what sort of lies she would be helping to perpetuate, since signing that single piece of paper meant that she would never again have to worry about how to feed her children.</p><p>These days they still dub in Tracey&#x2019;s voice for the singing, but even the speaking voice that Mother uses now, a voice that she probably thinks of as entirely her own, is a complete work of fiction. This used to make me angry, especially when she was yelling. I used to yell back, to try to push her into revealing her true self, that sharp twinge of Appalachia, the dropped consonants, the seemingly arbitrary vowels, but she never did. Eventually I began to suspect that maybe she had no true self remaining, that it was not just covered up but had been destroyed entirely.</p><p>&#x201c;You watched her?&#x201d; Candy asks, and here there is a hint of amusement.</p><p>I know she is picturing me on the toilet, skirt hiked up and underwear around my ankles, holding the stick with just the tips of my fingers as I try to pee on it without getting any on myself. As if such a feat were even possible.</p><p>&#x201c;I watched her.&#x201d;</p><p>In truth Mother had turned away once I began to shimmy down my cotton briefs. She hasn&#x2019;t seen my bum since I was potty trained, I don&#x2019;t think, and just the idea of that much flesh probably embarrassed her. But she heard the stream of urine, heard me place the stick on the edge of the sink beside her, watched as it turned blue. A mother&#x2019;s worst fear, or so some people say. But not my mother&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;And she told you she was afraid she might be pregnant?&#x201d; Candy asks.</p><p>How would that conversation have played out? I wonder, and once again I consider it. First off, I would have had to catch Mother alone with no risk of interruption, no easy task given the number of people who walk freely through our house. Then I would have had to make sure she was listening, truly listening, and not just nodding her head and gazing vaguely in my direction the way she often does. No, a conversation would have been too risky. There was too great a chance it would have gone according to her plan instead of according to mine. So I bought the pregnancy test and left it in my bathroom where I knew she would find it. Actually, I bought three, though I left the money on the shelf rather than going to the register. The first I used to confirm what I already knew. The second I left for her to find. The third I hid underneath my mattress in case denial kicked in and she threw the second away.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I found a pregnancy test in her bathroom where she had stashed it and I knew right then that something must be wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>From my perch on the dryer I almost laugh out loud. I find the notion that Mother does not realize that I know she goes through my bathroom drawers almost tragically comical. But more than that, this proposition that she possesses some heightened intuition, that she picked up on some subtle clue and swooped in just in time to play the hero, is blatantly absurd. The pieces to this puzzle should have been apparent to her all along.</p><p>&#x201c;And the father?&#x201d; Candy is asking. Here Mother is silent. There is the sound of papers being shuffled. Has she really brought notes to this meeting? She couldn&#x2019;t have. She wouldn&#x2019;t want there to be anything in writing, anything that might be tracked. The papers must be for something else, or maybe they are even blank, just there for effect. Maybe she is playing a part even within that room, just as she does outside it.</p><p>Finally, Mother answers Candy&#x2019;s question without really answering it at all. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to worry about him. He won&#x2019;t say a word.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Of course he won&#x2019;t, </i>I think. <i>He has the most to lose. </i></p><p>&#x201c;Well then,&#x201d; says Candy, who has lasted as long as she has by learning when to stop, when not to push. She can tell that this is information that Mother does not plan to share. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s run through our list of options. Gretchen?&#x201d;</p><p>At this I sit up straighter and turn my head so that my ear is pointed up toward the grate. I am curious to see if there are any options besides the ones of which I am already aware. I hear Gretchen clear her throat. She is younger than Candy and Mother, who are roughly the same age. Brown hair, sharp features, mousy, though that descriptor applies more to a tendency to twitch and scurry rather than to her actual appearance. Her face, taken by itself, is actually rather pretty. Gretchen works in media relations or publicity or whatever it is you call it when your job is to make a fairly unremarkable family universally recognized and adored.</p><p>At this, she and the others who came before her have been surprisingly successful. Recently I&#x2019;ve tried to dissect this improbability, but when I was growing up, I never really wondered why the show became so popular. Contrary to what some left-wing bloggers might say, this wasn&#x2019;t because I am at all conceited. It was because I lacked perspective. Mother said we were Called to lead by example, and the capital <i>C </i>hung in the air like something holy. So I believed her. I didn&#x2019;t know any better.</p><p>Other families had enjoyed their fifteen minutes of fame, their moment in the spotlight, only to have their shows canceled after a few seasons when the parents divorced or the child who was adorable at age four became positively homely at seven or failed to outgrow a lisp. Or maybe, for no discernible reason at all, the audience simply grew bored and advertising revenue dried up. Then the camera crews would pack up their things and retreat, leaving the house feeling empty, the living room just slightly too large, the rooms eerily quiet. Or so I always assumed.</p><p>I took it for granted, I guess, that we were special, we were chosen, or at the very least odd enough to be intriguing to those who continued to tune in season after season, year after year. Because they did tune in. They watched Daniel take his first steps, saw Mat...</p></p><h2>Do You Love Someone?</h2><p>Delicate illustrations and prose explore each individual&#39;s need for love and a sense of belonging in a complex world</p><p></p><h2>Core Connections: Course 3 Foundations for Algebra Toolkit</h2><p>The Core Connections courses are built on rich, meaningful problems and investigations that develop conceptual understanding of the mathematics and establish connections among different concepts.

As a journalist he has written extensively on cinema, crime, ancient history, and World War II. Munn lives in Suffolk, England.According to this congenial biography by film journalist Munn, movie legend Wayne (1907&#x2013;1979) was a hard worker who held tight to his beliefs and what he thought he should show on screen. Wayne's career did have its share of controversy (although he starred in cutthroat war films, Wayne didn't sign up for military service in WWII; he rejected communism, which made him the object of Stalinist threats; and the actor's given name is still debated), and Munn deftly addresses those hullabaloos while providing an overview of the actor's accomplishments. After playing football at USC, Wayne worked as a studio prop man, coming into early contact with director John Ford, who would direct Wayne in some of his most memorable performances, including 1952's The Quiet Man. Throughout their association, Ford treated Wayne erratically, disparaging his talents and lashing out at him for accepting a lead role from rival director Raoul Walsh (The Big Trail, 1930). Yet Ford and Wayne collaborated on 1939's Stagecoach, which gave birth to the serious western and the Ford-Wayne movie subgenre. Other highlights include Wayne's emergence as a heavy in 1948's Red River and his ferocious performance in 1956's The Searchers. Munn portrays the actor in his personal life as a man's man, who sustained friendships with tough cohorts like stuntman Yakima Canutt but failed in romance. Although the book takes an odd turn toward the end, when Munn links Wayne's patriotism and heroic persona to the heroic actions after September 11, overall, it's a fine tribute. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He loved looking at something in the room and making it come alive again in front of him.</i> He drew pictures for his sisters, his classmates, his co-workers. Even during W.W.I, Horace filled his notebooks with drawings from the trenches . . . until he was shot. Upon his return home, Horace couldn't lift his right arm, and couldn't make any art. Slowly, with lots of practice, he regained use of his arm, until once again, he was able to paint--and paint, and paint! Soon, people&#x2014;including the famous painter N. C.

Sibert Medal.*Starred Review* Born in Pennsylvania in 1888, Horace Pippin loved to draw and paint as a child. When he was in eighth grade, his father left the family. Horace quit school and worked to support them. Later wounded as a soldier in WWI, he never regained full use of his right arm. Back home, Pippin began painting again, using his left arm to guide his right. Painting subjects drawn mainly from observation, memory, family stories, and the Bible, this self-taught African American artist was eventually discovered by the art community. Major museums display his works, and their locations are indicated on the U.S. map on the back endpapers, along with small reproductions of six paintings. In a well-structured narrative with recurring themes and a highly accessible style, Bryant writes short sentences full of memorable details, from Pippin&#x2019;s first box of colored pencils to the scavenged house paints he used to paint his wartime memories. Combining drawings and printed elements with watercolor and gouache paints, Sweet&#x2019;s mixed-media illustrations have a refreshing, down-home style and a brilliance all their own. The artwork incorporates large-print quotes, giving Pippin a voice here as well. Outstanding. Grades 1-4. --Carolyn Phelan</p><h2>Aldous Huxley: A Biography</h2><p>When Aldous Huxley died on November 22, 1963, on the same day that John F. Kennedy was assassinated, he was widely considered to be one of the most intelligent and wide-ranging English writers of the twentieth century. Associated in the public mind with his dystopian satire, Brave New World, and experimentation with drugs that preceded the psychedelic, a term he invented, era of the 1960s, Huxley seemed to embody the condition of twentieth-century man in his restless curiosity, his search for meaning in a post-religious age, and his concern about the misuses of science and the future of the planet.<br><br>But Huxley was born when Queen Victoria was on the British throne. He was the grandson of the great Victorian scientist Thomas Henry Huxley &#x201c;Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog,&#x201d; and the great-nephew of the great poet and critic Matthew Arnold. Exiled in the Californian sun, he never ceased to think of himself as part of a tradition that could be traced back to the Victorian public intellectuals. <br><br>This biography of Huxley---the first in thirty years---draws on a substantial amount of unpublished material, as well as numerous interviews with his family and friends. It is a portrait of a daring and iconoclastic novelist; a man hampered by semi-blindness, who spent a restless life in search of personal enlightenment. Nicholas Murray charts Huxley&#x2019;s Bloomsbury years, his surprising and complex relationship with D. H. Lawrence, and his emigration to America in the late 1930s, where he pursued a career as a screenwriter while continuing his fascination with mysticism and religion. Huxley&#x2019;s private life was also unconventional, and this book reveals for the first time the extraordinary story of the m�nage � trois including Huxley, his remarkable wife, Maria, and the Bloomsbury socialite and mistress of Clive Bell, Mary Hutchinson.<br><br>Huxley emerges from this new biography as one of the most intriguing and complex figures of twentieth-century English writing---novelist, poet, biographer, philosopher, social and political thinker. In an era of intense specialization he remained a free-ranging thinker, unconfined by conventional categories, concerned to communicate his insights in ordinary language---a very English intellectual. <br></p><p>Nicholas Murray has written biographies of Bruce Chatwin, Matthew Arnold, and Andrew Marvell. Born in Liverpool, he now lives in London and Wales.<br>&nbsp; IAldous&#x2018;Born into the rain,&#x2019; Aldous Huxley told the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> in 1952, &#x2018;I have always felt a powerful craving for light.&#x2019;1 Huxley had in mind his lifelong struggle with defective eyesight, which sent him first to the Mediterranean and then to Southern California. But the wider metaphor is irresistible. His life was a constant search for light, for understanding, of himself and his fellow men and women in the twentieth century. This intellectual ambition &#x2013; not unknown but rare in English novelists &#x2013; sent him far beyond the confines of prose fiction into history, philosophy, science, politics, mysticism, psychic exploration. He offered as his personal motto the legend hung around the neck of a ragged scarecrow of a man in a painting by Goya: <i>aun aprendo</i>. I am still learning. Grandson of the great Victorian scientist Thomas Henry Huxley &#x2013; &#x2018;Darwin&#x2019;s bulldog&#x2019; &#x2013; he had a lifelong passion for truth, artistic and scientific. His field of interest, declared Isaiah Berlin after his death, was nothing less than &#x2018;the condition of men in the twentieth century&#x2019;.2Like an eighteenth century <i>philosophe</i>, a modern Voltaire &#x2013; though in truth he found that historical epoch lacking in depth and resonance &#x2013; he took the whole world as his province, and like those urbane thinkers he did it with consummate clarity and grace, was frequently iconoclastic, and struck many of his contemporaries in the early decades of the twentieth century as a liberator and a herald of the modern age of secular enlightenment and scientific progress. He was also an often disturbingly accurate prophet who became steadily more disillusioned with the uses to which science was being put in his time. His was an early voice in the ecological movement, which gathered pace after his death. He warned against the dangers of nuclear weapons, over-population, exhaustion of the world&#x2019;s natural resources, militarism and destructive nationalism. His subtler messages &#x2013; about the corrosive effects of modern consumer capitalism and brainwashing by advertising, about the slow surrender of freedom &#x2013; have made his most famous work, <i>Brave New World</i>, in many ways a more accurate prophecy than Orwell&#x2019;s <i>1984</i>. From a certain point of view, it is true, Huxley&#x2019;s brand of high amateurism might look a little anachronistic in an era of intense academic specialisation &#x2013; he loved to mock &#x2018;the professors&#x2019; (not least when he became a &#x2018;Visiting Professor of Nothing in Particular&#x2019; himself) and considered no subject, however abstruse, alien to him. The wide-ranging intellectual, acknowledging no disciplinary barriers, nor feeling the need to kow-tow to the appointed custodians of this or that area of knowledge, if not extinct is certainly an endangered species. The example of Huxley &#x2013; who constituted what Rosamund Lehmann called &#x2018;a luminous intelligence incarnate&#x2019;3 &#x2013; serves as a reminder of what might be at stake were the species to disappear for good.But Huxley was never &#x2013; in spite of his prodigious intellectual gifts &#x2013; a mere desiccated calculating machine. It is true that he confessed to &#x2018;a fear of the responsibilities of relationships&#x2019;.4 And he admitted: &#x2018;I know how to deal with abstract ideas but not people&#x2019;.5 In spite of his exceptional intelligence and his frequent impatience with human stupidity (expressed more at a theoretical than at a personal level) Huxley was a surprisingly modest and self-effacing man. He showed an exceptionally acute perception of his own shortcomings as a man and as a writer. In the 1940s, Huxley was smitten by the classification of human types drawn up by Dr William Sheldon in <i>The Varieties of Human Physique</i> and <i>The Varieties of Temperament</i>. In this scheme, Huxley was a &#x2018;cerebrotonic&#x2019;, a term that would crop up regularly in his later works. In an article which appeared in <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i> in November 1944, with droll illustrations by James Thurber, Huxley explained the characteristics of his own type: <br>The cerebrotonic is the over-alert, over-sensitive introvert, who is more concerned with the inner universe of his own thoughts and feelings and imagination than with the external world ... In posture and movements, the cerebrotonic person is tense and restrained. His reactions may be unduly rapid and his physiological responses uncomfortably intense ... Extreme cerebrotonics ... have a passion for privacy, hate to make themselves conspicuous ... In company they tend to be shy and unpredictably moody ... Their normal manner is inhibited and restrained and when it comes to the expression of feelings they are outwardly so inhibited that viscerotonics suspect them of being heartless.6<br>Huxley, however, was not &#x2018;heartless&#x2019;. As a young writer in the twenties, he was seen as a cold-eyed and ruthless satirist, disgusted by human folly, but the underlying humanity was always there, and keener readers noticed it.One sticky afternoon in Los Angeles in the early part of the year 2000, I was taken by a gentle Armenian taxi-driver &#x2013; with perfect manners and an imperfect grasp of the street-plan of Hollywood &#x2013; to the house in Mulholland Highway in the Hollywood Hills where Huxley ended his life and where his second wife, Laura Archera Huxley, still lives. Sitting on the verandah at the back of the house, in view of the famous white HOLLYWOOD letters erected on the hillside at what seemed only a stone&#x2019;s throw away, I found myself asking Mrs Huxley at one point in our conversation about the view of Huxley that had been disseminated widely towards the end of his life: that he had been transformed into an other-worldly sage, abstracted, almost ethereal, his moorings cut loose from the world. It is a common view of Huxley in the 1950s and 1960s. Laura Huxley dissented vigorously: &#x2018;He was very <i>present</i> and light and amused,&#x2019; she insisted. We had been talking for more than an hour. The light had begun to fade and a cool breeze bringing the scent of vegetation was blowing gently in from the hills. Mosquitoes, like tiny paratroopers landing on an enemy beach, were dropping in at angles. There was a long pause: <br>I cannot tell you how gentle and tender the man was: accepting and tender and caring.<br>Laura Huxley&#x2019;s comments echo many of the tributes made at the time of his death. Testimonies to what Leonard Woolf called his &#x2018;essential gentleness and sweetness&#x2019;7 abounded. For Osbert Sitwell he was &#x2018;that rare thing, a good man&#x2019; and for Isaiah Berlin &#x2018;a wholly civilised, good and scrupulous man&#x2019;.8Present-day criticism and biography is not at ease with this way of speaking about writers. Until very recently critics were pre-occupied with formal and theoretical questions. The writer&#x2019;s moral stance was considered, in Derrida&#x2019;s words &#x2018;<i>hors-texte</i>&#x2019; &#x2013; beyond the text and therefore irrelevant. But nothing dates more quickly than critical fashion and there are growing signs of dissatisfaction with such narrow approaches. We are perhaps now ready again for Huxley and writers like him. On the other hand, those who have called Huxley a secular saint (when coined by Gladstone to describe John Stuart Mill, that epithet was intended to carry an ambivalent charge) run the risk of inviting a sceptical reaction. Yet even the unillusioned Cyril Connolly, interviewing Huxley for <i>Picture Post</i> in 1948, was forced to conclude that the man he had met at Claridges during the West End run of one of his plays was qualitatively different from the general run of contemporary authors: <br>If one looks at his face one gets first an impression of immense intelligence, but this is not unusual among artists. What is much more remarkable and almost peculiar to him is the radiance of serenity and loving-kindness on his features; one no longer feels &#x2018;what a clever man&#x2019; but &#x2018;what a good man,&#x2019; a man at peace with himself and plunged as well &#x2013; indeed, fully engaged &#x2013; in the eternal conflict between good and evil, awareness and stupidity.&#x2019;9<br>Huxley&#x2019;s philosophy might be summed up as: the world can be made better, but only if we make ourselves better. He was not an ideologist, a writer of manifestos, a practical politician. But he wanted to change minds &#x2013; or to release their potential. His intelligence roamed freely and was uninterested in boundaries. In California, he gave lunch to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the batty science of dianetics &#x2013; for the simple reason that he wanted to find out what he had to say &#x2013; and when a friend wrote about flying saucers he confessed that he had &#x2018;no settled opinion so far&#x2019; about whether or not they existed.10 An open mind is such a rarity that perhaps we should hesitate to censure it.But, in addition to the intellect and the moral vision, there was the physical man. Huxley was immensely tall &#x2013; six feet four-and-a half inches &#x2013; and the near-blindness that afflicted him for much of his life sometimes gave him an air of strangeness, perhaps intimidating for those who met him for the first time. For Christopher Isherwood who knew him in his southern California years he was &#x2018;too tall. I felt an enormous zoological separation from him. There is a very, very great chasm between the tall and the short.&#x2019;11 For the scallywags of Hampstead where Huxley lived in a tiny flat just after he was married in 1919, he was the spindly Old Etonian toff they would tease in the street by shouting up to him: &#x2018;Is it cold up there, guv?&#x2019;12 Virginia Woolf confided to her diary after her first meeting that he was &#x2018;infinitely long&#x2019;. It was on the lawn at Garsington, while scanning the manuscripts of Gerald Manley Hopkins which Robert Bridges had just handed to her, that she looked up at &#x2018;that gigantic grasshopper Aldous folded up in a chair close by&#x2019;. A few years later she met him at a concert &#x2018;more of a windmill and a scarecrow, more highbrow, purblind and pallid and spavined than ever&#x2019;.13 The zoological comparisons proliferate. Sybille Bedford noticed at her first meeting with him: &#x2018;the apartness, the vulnerability, the curious young bird&#x2019;s unprotectedness that has caught so many women&#x2019;.14 Then there were the botanical analogies: to Frieda Lawrence he was a &#x2018;weed&#x2019;15 and to Sewell Stokes &#x2018;like a tall sad tulip, whose head rests a little too heavily on its stalk&#x2019;.16 To the children of St John and Mary Hutchinson, he was &#x2018;the Quangle-Wangle&#x2019;.17 Anita Loos, a close friend of Huxley in Southern California, was struck by his &#x2018;physical beauty ... the head of an angel drawn by William Blake. His faulty sight even intensified Aldous&#x2019;s majesty, for he appeared to be looking at things above and beyond what other people saw.&#x2019;18 Mary Hutchinson was struck by his physical appearance: &#x2018;so long and gentle and languid suggesting untouchable withdrawn snail&#x2019;s horns in strange contrast to his flowing outgoing mind&#x2019;.19And there was the famous voice: beautifully modulated, silvery, precise. Listening to a recording of himself, pressed on vinyl in the summer of 1949, when he had lived in Southern California for more than a decade, Huxley reflected: <br>Language is perpetually changing; the cultivated English I listened to as a child is not the same as the cultivated English spoken by young men and women today. But within the general flux there are islands of linguistic conservatism; and when I listen to myself objectively, from the outside, I perceive that I am one of those islands. In the Oxford of Jowett and Lewis Carroll, the Oxford in which my mother was brought up, how did people speak the Queen&#x2019;s English? I can answer with a considerable degree of confidence that they spoke almost exactly as I do. These recordings of 1950 are at the same time documents from the seventies and eighties of the last century.20<br>Locked for a day in a booth at the National Sound Archive in London, listening to that voice &#x2013; unaltered by years of residence in the United States &#x2013; &#x2018;neat as a seamstress&#x2019;s stitching&#x2019;21 as his friend Gerald Heard put it, one can testify to the accuracy of another friend, Raymond Mortimer&#x2019;s, judgement that, &#x2018;his voice and articulation remained the most exquisite I have ever known.&#x2019;22 His conversation was peppered with &#x2018;how <i>extraordinary</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>fascinating</i>&#x2019;, and with casual references to leading contemporary authorities on this or that branch of knowledge and effortlessly deployed allusions to past masters (&#x2018;There&#x2019;s a very <i>striking</i> phrase in Spinoza ...&#x2019;). Just occasionally, that easeful, liquid articulation, the tone almost of languor, rises a little to a degree that could become, were it to be taken a little further, querulousness, as if the speaker cannot quite comprehend the sheer enormity of human folly in his time, falling back exhausted at the spectacle. Yet the speaking voice was the man and Yehudi Menuhin declared, &#x2018;he had made himself into an instrument of music ... his voice was the gentlest melody.&#x2019;23&#x2018;Aldous,&#x2019; observed his nephew, Francis Huxley. &#x2018;How well the name suited him, and how often have I heard people refer to him with familiar reverence by that name alone, as though there were but one Aldous in the history of the world!&#x2019;24Aldous Huxley was born in 1894, when Queen Victoria was on the throne of England. As a child he glimpsed the Queen in old age, taking carriage exercise in Windsor Great Park, attended by her faithful servant John Brown.25 He died in Hollywood, in 1963, a few hours after the fatal shots rang out from the Texas Book Depository in Dallas which killed President John F. Kennedy. He was the grandson of a great Victorian scientist and the great-nephew of the Victorian poet and critic, Matthew Arnold. He was thus a kind of conduit or link between the world of high Victorian liberal intellectualism and the world of the twentieth century, whose course those ardent, progressively-minded meliorists could not have predicted. It was this aspect of Huxley which first drew me to him, for I had written the life of Matthew Arnold, and was curious to explore the ways in which that nineteenth century tradition of the writer and thinker as enlightened public intellectual had persisted into the modern era. In his youth, Huxley was seen by his contemporaries as the opponent of that Victorian inheritance, a defiantly modern figure who was breaking free &#x2013; and encouraging others to break free &#x2013; from what was perceived as a stuffy, reactionary order of society. The eponymous heroine of <i>Two or Three Graces</i> (1926) knows what she is up against: <br>As for Grace&#x2019;s parents, they were only a generation away; but, goodness knows, that was far enough. They had opinions about socialism and sexual morality, and gentlemen, and what ought or ought not to be done by the best people &#x2013; fixed, unalterable, habit-ingrained and by now almost instinctive opinions that made it impossible for them to understand or forgive the contemporary world.26<br>Seen in a wider context, however, profounder continuities can be seen at work. Huxley&#x2019;s passion both for science (even though he was painfully aware of the misuses of science in his time) and for communicating to a large public recall his grandfather&#x2019;s determination to bring scientific knowledge to ordinary people, in plain language, in his lectures at the Royal Institution, attended by working men and cab-drivers, one of whom famously refused to accept a fare in gratitude for what he had heard. On his mother&#x2019;s side, the Arnoldian inheritance of urbane public discourse and a love and practice of poetry is plain. Huxley had no time for those who would erect barriers between art and science, knowing them to be two complementary modes of knowing, as Thomas Henry Huxley and Matthew Arnold had agreed them to be a century before, when Arnold vigorously insisted to his f...</p><h2>The prairie school; Frank Lloyd Wright and his midwest contemporaries</h2><p><p><strong>One of the most original and dynamic developments in American architecture, the Prairie School was a regional manifestation of the international revolt and reform that occurred in the visual arts during the early years of the twentieth century.</strong></p>Inspired by Louis Sullivan and given guidance and prominence by Frank Lloyd Wright, the members of the movement sought to achieve a fresh architectural expression. Their designs were characterized by precise, angular forms and highly sophisticated interior arrangements-an approach that proved immensely significant in residential architecture. H. Allen Brooks discusses the entire phenomenon of the Prairie School-not just the masters but also the work of their contemporaries. Drawing on unpublished material and original documentation as well as on interviews, he assesses each architect�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s contribution and traces the course of the movement itself-how and why it came into existence, what it achieved, and what caused its abrupt end.</p><p>H. Allen Brooks may be credited with coining the designation &#x2019;Prairie School&#x2019; with the publication of his doctoral dissertation of that name in 1957. His classic work The Prairie School, which received the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award from the Society of Architectural Historians for the most distinguished work of scholarship in the history of architecture published by a North American scholar in 1971&#x2013;72, has been in print continuously since then. Professor emeritus of fine arts at the University of Toronto and a past president of the Society of Architectural Historians, Brooks is also the author of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School and Le Corbusier&#x2019;s Formative Years and is the editor of Prairie School Architecture: Studies from the &#x2019;Western Architect,&#x2019; Writings on Wright, The Le Corbusier Archive, and Le Corbusier.<br><br>Vincent Scully has been widely honored as one of the most gifted historians and critics of architecture.

But the real story is a lot more interesting: indeed, there are more than two million operators worldwide, including people like Walter Cronkite and Priscilla Presley. Gandhi had a ham radio, as do Marlon Brando and Juan Carlos, king of Spain.<br> Hello World takes us on a seventy-year odyssey through the world of ham radio. From 1927 until his death in 2001, operator Jerry Powell transmitted radio signals from his bedroom in Hackensack, New Jersey, touring the world&#x2019;s most remote locations and communicating with people from Greenland to occupied Japan. Once he made contact with a fellow ham operator, he exchanged postcards &#x2013; known as QSLs cards &#x2013; with them. For seven decades, Powell collected hundreds of these cards, documenting his fascinating career in amateur radio and providing a dazzling graphic inventory of people and places far flung. <br> This book is both an introduction to the fascinating world of ham and a visual feast for anyone interested in the universal language of graphic design.</p><p>Danny Gregory lives in New York City.<br><br>Paul Sahre is principal of his own design firm.

Reprint.</p><p>Can this marriage be saved? Oregon's take-no-prisoners defense attorney Barbara Holloway wed geologist John Mureau in her last book, and already things are looking bad. The problem isn't Barbara's lack of cooking skills: her father, Frank, has enough of those to spare and will whip up a gourmet meal for everyone in sight at the slightest pretext. Nor is it the crush of living and office space--renting two adjoining apartments in a new building in Eugene takes care of that. What really bothers John is the constant danger that Barbara's work conjures up for her, for her family, and now for his children, if they should be around when a case explodes.<p> Barbara Holloway is using every slick legal arrow in her quiver to make sure that her client, Maggie Folsum, gets to keep a large lump of cash that her career criminal husband left behind when he trashed Maggie's bed and breakfast and then was found beaten to death. The danger to Holloway begins when Maggie's brother-in-law is charged with the murder, even though the most obvious candidate is the crime boss who employed (and was double-crossed by) the late husband. Will Barbara fight off the IRS in time to defend the innocent brother-in-law? Will the mysterious mobster (powerful enough to make witnesses perjure themselves) actually give up his minions if pressed hard enough? Will John and Barbara stay together in those two terrific apartments, and will her white sauce ever work?

Amish quilts in crib and youth-bed sizes are not made with the frequency that full-sized Amish quilts are made, despite the relatively large families common within Amish society. Collectors, dealers, scholars, and quilt aficionados appreciate Amish quilts for their visual qualities and exceptionally fine needlework, but some collectors especially prize the so-called crib quilts made by Amish women because of their rarity and special status. Therefore, I was intrigued when a collection of 90 Amish crib quilts was offered to the International Quilt Study Center (IQSC) by Xenia Cord, owner of an antique quilts brokerage in Kokomo, Indiana. The collection had been assembled by Sara Miller from Kalona, Iowa, a woman who had spent much of her life as a member of the Old Order Amish church.<br>Our surprise at being offered such a unique collection prompted us to engage Darwin Bearley to survey and evaluate the Miller Collection. Bearley, an antique quilt dealer located in Akron, Ohio, owns a personal collection of Amish crib quilts numbering about 50. He expressed surprise that he had never heard of the Amish woman who assembled such a large collection of crib quilts. After viewing the collection, he stated that he believed all were authentic and that the quality in general was "extremely high." He felt that a number of the crib quilts were "very unusual and unique ones." With the Sara Miller Collection of Amish crib quilts vetted, Robert and Ardis James generously decided to acquire the remarkable collection on behalf of the IQSC in September, 2000, preserving it for future generations to study and enjoy. <br>The Miller Collection consists of 90 Amish crib quilts, dating from the early 1900s to the 1960s. With single-minded purpose and a discerning eye, Sara Miller assembled this extraordinary collection. She occupies a unique position among collectors of Amish quilts. She is one of the few insiders (possibly the only insider) who has amassed a collection of Amish quilts, and the only collector affiliated with the Amish who has assembled a collection of crib quilts, so far as we can tell.<br>Soon after we acquired the Miller Collection, IQSC Curator Carolyn Ducey and I began to explore possible venues for an exhibition on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus. Since most of the Miller quilts were believed to have a Midwestern provenance, we decided to approach Reese Summers, Curator of the Great Plains Art Collection. He responded with enthusiasm and a willingness to devote one part of the new Christlieb Gallery for an entire year to the proposed exhibition. As planning progressed for the future exhibition, we determined that it would not be possible to display all 90 quilts at one time in the Great Plains Art Collection Christlieb Gallery. At the same time, it was the firm belief of Reese Summers that the exhibition would have greater appeal to audiences if all 90 quilts were displayed. Therefore, we decided to display 22 to 23 quilts at a time, with a new group every three months, so that visitors could see the entire collection by returning to view each of the four rotations between February 2003 and February 2004. <br>Fortuitously, about the time that preliminary planning began for the future exhibition of the Miller Collection, a new graduate student, Janneken Smucker, entered the University of Nebraska's masters program in textile history with a quilt studies emphasis. She expressed an interest in undertaking the curatorial research for the exhibition as her masters project. Researching the Miller Collection and serving as exhibition curator matched Janneken's background, education, and interests: Janneken Smucker is of Mennonite background and is a graduate in history and women's studies from Goshen (Indiana) College, a small Mennonite liberal arts college. Not only is she descended from a line of quiltmakers, she is a quiltmaker herself. Her educational and religious background (both the Amish and the Mennonites are Germanic sectarian religious groups) provided her with special insights into the Amish culture, thereby enriching her research of the collection and informing her thoughtful essay in this volume.<br>Another fortuitous circumstance, which further contributed to the scholarship of this project, was Dr. Linda Welters' application for an IQSC Visiting Faculty Fellowship. Dr. Welters is Professor of Textiles, Fashion Merchandising and Design at the University of Rhode Island. She proposed to apply symmetry analysis to the Sara Miller Collection of Amish crib quilts. Symmetry analysis can be applied to repeating patterns found in nature and human artifacts. <i> </i>The model for symmetry analysis that Welters proposed to use was set forth by Dorothy Washburn and Donald Crowe in Symmetries of Culture: Theory and Practice of Plane Pattern Analysis. They demonstrate how preferences for particular symmetry patterns offer clues to cultural beliefs and practices, including aspects of group identity and cultural contact. Welters argued persuasively that quilts with their repeating block patterns were well suited to meaningful symmetry analysis. She further noted that, "Connecting quilts to cultural patterns requires a substantial number of quilts from a culture or region. The 90 Amish crib quilts in the Sara Miler Collection at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln offer such an opportunity." The Fellows of the International Quilt Study Center voted unanimously to award her the Visiting Faculty Fellowship for 2002-2003. Her intriguing essay for this volume is the product of her research at the IQSC. <br>Carolyn Ducey and I anticipated that the exhibition would be of interest to other museums, and, indeed, that proved to be the case. Merle and Phyllis Good, owners of Good Books and directors/curators of The People's Place Quilt Museum in Intercourse, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, visited the IQSC during Sep-tember, 2002, to explore the possibility of future exhibitions and publications in partnership with the IQSC. After learning more about the planned exhibition of the Miller Collection, they immediately expressed an interest in serving as a venue for the Midwestern Amish crib quilt exhibition and in publishing the accompanying book. The timing of their initial visit could not have been better. We are very pleased that in March, 2003, the first of two rotations of this exhibition will travel to The People's Place Quilt Museum, a museum devoted to the exhibition of antique Amish and Mennonite quilts. Located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, The People's Place Quilt Museum promises to bring the Sara Miller Collection to the attention of appreciative visitors and residents of the oldest existing Amish settlement in the United States. <br>(continued)<br><br></p><h2>British Literature 449-1798</h2><p>Product in good condition some pages turned.</p><p></p><h2>Traitors&#39; Gate (Crossroads)</h2><p><p>In <i>Spirit Gate</i> and <i>Shadow Gate</i>, Kate Elliott took readers to the fascinating world of the Hundred, a land teeming with an array of cultures, gods, and conflicts blighted by the shadow of chaos and destruction. Now, with the same intensity and dramatic sweep that has brought this epic to life, Elliott returns to the exquisitely crafted cities and landscapes of the Hundred, in a thunderous conclusion to the saga.</p>In the darkness of war and destruction, forces gather to reclaim the peace: Those immortal Guardians who still serve justice seek a means to end the devastating reign of one of their own; a hired outlander army struggles to halt the advance of the horde that has despoiled vast lands and slaughtered countless people in its murderous wake, while still guarding against a burgeoning threat from an aggressively expansionist empire; and the eagle reeves who have long been the only law enforcers of the Hundred struggle to reorganize after a devastating massacre has decimated their numbers. But even as these forces give hope to those who would live in peace, a terrible danger looms: a traitor with Imperial ambitions, the most dreaded, least anticipated threat of all...<br><br>In the unfolding drama of political upheaval and violent change, nothing is certain, as alliances dissolve and power shifts with the unpredictability of a desert sandstorm. A riotous epic with the vast breadth and excitement only masterful storyteller Kate Elliott can summon, Traitors&#x2019; Gate will leave her many readers begging for more.</p><p>KATE ELLIOTT is the bestselling author of more than a dozen epic novels.

At first he thought himself in the Hundred, in the city of Olossi, still bound as a debt slave to Master Feden. Then he smelled the rancid aroma of the harsh local oil used for cooking. He heard shouts, jabbering words he could not understand.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t in the Hundred. He was in the Sirniakan Empire.</p><p>He groped for the short sword he had stashed under the cot.</p><p>"Eh? Keshad?" A bleary voice murmured on the other side of the curtain.</p><p>"Quiet. There&#x2019;s trouble."</p><p>The cloth rippled as Eliar wrestled with clothing, or his turban, or whatever the hells the Silvers were so cursed prudish about. Bracelets jangled. There came a curse, a rattle, and a thump as the cot tipped over.</p><p>"Where&#x2019;s the lamp?"</p><p>"Hush." Kesh wrapped his kilt around his waist, approached the door, and, leaning against it, pressed an ear to the crack. All quiet.</p><p>"Nothing to do with us," he whispered. "Yet."</p><p>The cot scraped, being righted. "The Sirniakan officials have locked us in the compound, won&#x2019;t let us trade, and hand over a scant portion of rice and millet once a day so we don&#x2019;t starve. One of their priests told you the emperor is dead, killed in battle by his cousin. They&#x2019;ve locked down Sardia and are restricting all movement. These troubles have everything to do with us. We have to get out of here, return to Olossi, and report these developments to Captain Anji."</p><p>"Say it a bit louder, perhaps. That will help us, neh? If everyone figures out we&#x2019;re spies?"</p><p>"No need to constantly criticize me&#x2014;"</p><p>Aui! No matter how much he disliked Eliar, he had to make this expedition work or he&#x2019;d never get what he wanted. And to get what he wanted, he had to stay on Eliar&#x2019;s good side.</p><p>"I beg your pardon. It&#x2019;s hateful to be stuck in this cursed compound day and night."</p><p>Eliar grunted in acknowledgment of the apology, which Kesh knew was grace-lessly delivered. "We&#x2019;ve got to do something."</p><p>Kesh jiggered the latch and cracked the door. It was strange to deal with hinges instead of proper doors that slid, but in the empire things were done one way or not at all, and if you didn&#x2019;t like it, the priests would condemn you to the fire. In the courtyard, a lamp hanging from a bracket illuminated the storehouse gates, but the far walls with their set-back doors into other storerooms and sleeping cells remained hidden in shadows. Trumpets, shouting, and clash of weapons swelled in the distance, well away from the restricted market district where foreign merchants were required to reside and carry out all their trade. A whiff of burning oil stung his nose as a flame flared behind him.</p><p>"Pinch that down, you fool!" he whispered. "We don&#x2019;t want anyone to know we&#x2019;re awake." Nothing stirred in the courtyard. If anyone had seen that flare of light, they weren&#x2019;t acting on it. "Listen, Eliar, you stay here. Make sure no one goes after our trade goods. I&#x2019;m going to the gate to see what the guards will tell me."</p><p>"The guards never tell us a cursed thing."</p><p>"They talk to me because I worship at the Beltak temple."</p><p>That shut Eliar up.</p><p>Keshad sheathed his sword and slung the sword belt over his back. He eased into the courtyard and padded cautiously past the open inner gate to the forecourt. The double gates had been barred for eight days, since the night when trumpets and horns had disturbed the peace and all the markets had been closed. Several figures huddled by the ranks of handcarts. One raised a lamp.</p><p>"Master Keshad? Maybe you can get these cursed guards to talk to you, since they favor you so much."</p><p>The other Hundred merchants didn&#x2019;t like him any better than he liked them. They thought him a traitor for abandoning the gods of his birth for the empire&#x2019;s god, but what did it matter to them what god he chose to worship or what benefit that worship brought him? There were a pair of outlanders as well, a man out of the Mariha princedoms and one from the western desert whose slaves, languishing in the slave pens, he hadn&#x2019;t seen for days. For that matter, the drivers and guardsmen he and Eliar had hired in Olossi were confined in different quarters altogether, and he&#x2019;d had no contact with them since the citywide curfew was imposed.</p><p>He rang the bell at the guardhouse. A guard in one of the watch platforms above turned to look down into the forecourt. Bars scraped and locks rattled. The guardhouse door opened and the sergeant pushed into the forecourt, a pair of armed guards at his back and another guard holding high a lamp.</p><p>"Get inside!"</p><p>His angry words drove the merchants back into the main courtyard.</p><p>Keshad held his ground. "Honored one, may I ask if we are in danger here?"</p><p>The sergeant&#x2019;s expression softened. "I know nothing. Men have broken curfew. Best you get inside until the storm passes."</p><p>The storm roared closer. A clatter of running feet in a nearby street was followed by a chorus of shouts so loud the sergeant flinched. Kesh took a step back from the double gates. The distinctive clamor of clashing swords and spears hammered the night, the skirmish racing as though one group was chasing another. The guards drew their swords; a fifth man popped out of the guardhouse.</p><p>"All ranks at the ready," snarled the sergeant, and the man vanished back into the tower. "They may try to break in."</p><p>The skirmish flowed along the street outside as Kesh gripped his sword so tightly he was shaking. The noise reached a pitch and abruptly subsided.</p><p>The sergeant exhaled. He spoke to his guards in the local language, but Kesh was too rattled to catch more than a word here and there. Foreigners. Market. Fire. Traitors to the emperor.</p><p>Kesh glanced through the open door into the guardhouse, which snaked through the compound wall; there was a small gate for the guard unit on the street side because the guards watched both ways, keeping locals out and foreigners in.</p><p>As though slapped by a giant hand, the gates shuddered. The sergeant swore, signaled to his men, and bolted inside, swinging the door shut. A struggle erupted outside. Several merchants came running from the main courtyard, but Kesh shoved past them and ran to his cell, where Eliar waited by the door.</p><p>"These gods-rotted empire laws have us caged like beasts," Kesh snapped, "not a chance to get in or out nor anywhere to hide or escape to. Curse them."</p><p>"Maybe we can get out over the roofs. I&#x2019;ve had plenty of practice getting in and out of tight places in Olossi. My friends and I, we smuggled goods over the river."</p><p>In the forecourt, merchants shouted, "Block the gate!" "Block the guardhouse door!"</p><p>Kesh began to laugh, because there wasn&#x2019;t anything else to find funny in their situation. "The hells! Were you part of that gang the Greater Houses were constantly chasing?"</p><p>He felt the sting of Eliar&#x2019;s smile as though he could touch it. "I was."</p><p>"Aui! You didn&#x2019;t really get up on the roof, did you?"</p><p>"I did. One night when you were sleeping. I used rope tied around the lamp brackets. But there&#x2019;s a walkway around the entire roof. They patrol it all night."</p><p>"Keeping us in, or others out. Grab rope. And whatever you can carry that&#x2019;s too valuable to leave behind."</p><p>"Climbing out of the compound is easy. But how can we get out of the city without being killed?"</p><p>"The hells!" Kesh collected the pouches of local spices, best-quality braid, and polished gems he&#x2019;d brought south from the Hundred; he slung them over his back, buckling tight the straps so the pouches wouldn&#x2019;t shift as he moved. Then he grabbed rope coiled against the door that led into a small storeroom accessible only from this chamber. None of the goods he and Eliar had stored in there were worth his life.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m ready," said the Ri Amarah from the door.</p><p>Eliar&#x2019;s bulging packs brushed Kesh&#x2019;s arm. "What in the hells are you carrying?"</p><p>"All the oil of naya."</p><p>"Aui! Don&#x2019;t drop it by a flame."</p><p>Kesh shouldered past and led Eliar to the archway of the inner gate. A few merchants were frantically shoving carts and benches in front of the closed double gates, but the rest were hiding in the storerooms. A struggle raged within the gatehouse, and outside the gates a crowd screamed words Kesh was pretty sure meant something like "Kill the foreigners! Kill the traitors!"</p><p>"They haven&#x2019;t given us up," said Kesh suddenly.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"The sergeant and his guards could let that mob in. But they&#x2019;re defending us. Eiya! We&#x2019;ll need oil of naya."</p><p>He expected Eliar to protest, but the other man swung down his bulky packs. Ke-shad ran to the cistern in the middle of the courtyard and climbed up.</p><p>"Heya! Heya! Get your weapons! Move! Our guards are defending us against a mob that wants to kill us. If we don&#x2019;t help them, we&#x2019;re all dead. I need rags. Anything that will burn easily. Hurry, you cursed fools!"</p><p>He ran to the forecourt. The guards had abandoned the watch platforms that flanked the gates. Access to the platforms and the wall walk was from inside the guardhouse, now being fought over.</p><p>Merchants came running with weapons, with rags, one dragging a thin pallet. Two carried lamps. Eliar brought three leather bottles. Muffled crashes and shouts came from the guardhouse. Someone was taking a beating.</p><p>Keshad indicated the platforms above. "We&#x2019;ll splash oil of naya over the crowd, light rags, and throw them down on top. That should drive them away."</p><p>"Heh. Just like the battle over Olossi," said one man.</p><p>"I&#x2019;ll go up," said Eliar immediately.</p><p>As Kesh slung a bottle over his shoulder he called the other merchants closer. "Those who can fight, brace yourselves. Form up around the inner gate. Tip carts over, under the arch, to make a bottleneck. One of you roust out the cowards. We need everyone. Now, hoist me up."</p><p>Kesh and another man climbed up on a cart. The man laced his fingers together and, when Kesh set a foot into the makeshift stirrup, raised him up so he could throw rope around one of the poles making the scaffolding of the platform. He clambered up and crouched on the platform as Eliar was helped up on the other side. The mob below hadn&#x2019;t yet spotted them. Men surged past the guardhouse door, pushing inside only to be cut down by the armed guardsmen. But the mob was growing, howling and barking like animals, or so it seemed to his ears. Workingmen who had, Kesh supposed, filled up with fear and now had to take it out on someone else, they were armed with torches, sticks, tools, and other such humble implements. None seemed to have bows. He licked his lips, tasted smoke. Elsewhere in the market district, compounds were burning.</p><p>The top of the twinned gates was broad enough to walk across if you didn&#x2019;t mind the height. Eliar hauled up a basket and crouched beside it, lifting out a burning lantern. Below, within the mob, a face looked up. Down along the street about ten men came running carrying ladders.</p><p>Keshad unsealed the first bottle. This was the dangerous part! He shook the vessel, oil spraying on the men crowded up below. Eliar set fire to a rag and flung it outward, but it fell to the ground and was stamped out. Men threw sticks and debris up at them. The first ladder was pushed up against the gate. Keshad emptied the first vessel on top of the men at the base of the ladder. He unsealed the second and ran out along the top of the gate, flinging oil out as far away as he could. Men cursed at him, wiping away the oil that splashed on their faces. Spreading it. A second flaming rag fluttered down, and a third&#x2014;</p><p>Fire touched oil on skin.</p><p>Shrieking, the man staggered, slamming into the men around him, half of whom had been splashed by oil of naya. The conflagration spread. The mob disintegrated as men fled in terror. The stench was horrible, and the screams were worse. But the street was clearing fast.</p><p>Keshad ran back to the platform, swung his legs over, and paid out the rope to let himself down to the forecourt. When he touched earth, his legs gave out. He pitched forward as the merchants babbled and cried.</p><p>Eliar bent over him. "Keshad? Are you hurt?"</p><p>"Neh." His speech was gone. His limbs were weak. He still heard screams.</p><p>"That saved us," added Eliar.</p><p>"For now."</p><p>"Clever of you to think of it. Just like at Olossi."</p><p>The door to the guardhouse scraped open and the sergeant stumbled out, blood splashed all over him. Seen past the sergeant, a whitewashed room looked like a slaughterhouse, with tumbled corpses, the hazy smoke of torches, and a guardsman kneeling beside a fallen comrade.</p><p>"What do you? What do you?" The sergeant loomed over him, swiping smears of blood from his beard with his left hand while he extended the right. "Good, good."</p><p>Hesitantly, Keshad reached out, and the man clasped elbows in the grasp of kinship seen in the market among believers but never extended to foreigners.</p><p>SOON AFTER DAWN, a squad of mounted soldiers resplendent in green sashes and helmets trimmed with gold ribbons clattered up to the closed gates. Smoke drifted over the rooftops. The merchants who had sat the rest of the night on watch on the roofs hastily clambered down as the gates were opened.</p><p>The sergeant genuflected before the squad&#x2019;s captain. As the sergeant kept his head bowed, they exchanged a running jabber in their own language. An older merchant murmured a translation.</p><p>"There was trouble all across the market district last night. There is to be an inquiry anywhere local men were killed."</p><p>"Against the mob, or against us?" Kesh muttered.</p><p>Worry creased the sergeant&#x2019;s face as he surveyed the merchants. The captain snapped a command that made the sergeant wince. With an apologetic grimace he pointed&#x2014;quite rudely, as outlanders always did, using the fingers&#x2014;at Keshad.</p><p>"Bring him." The captain&#x2019;s gaze paused on Eliar, with his butter-yellow turban. "You come, also."</p><p>Eliar took an obedient step toward the squad, but Keshad held his ground.</p><p>"What about our trade goods? What surety do we have they&#x2019;ll not be stolen while we&#x2019;re not here to guard them ourselves?"</p><p>The captain raised a hand, and soldiers drew their swords. "You come. Or I kill you."</p><p>Keshad wiped sweat from his eyes as his throat closed over a pointless protest. He shrugged, pretending calm. Eliar looked as if he&#x2019;d been struck.</p><p>They walked under the market district gate and into the main city, a place no foreign merchant was ever allowed to enter. The empty streets were broad and clean-swept, walled on both sides, with gates opening at intervals into compounds. The hooves of the horses echoed in an eerie silence. Once Kesh saw a face peeping over a wall, dropping out of sight when their gazes met. Their procession wound inward and upward as the sun rose, and just when it was beginning to get really hot they arrived at a vast gate that opened into a grand courtyard lined with pillared colonnades carved of finest white marble.</p><p>The captain indicated a bench in the shade. "Sit there."</p><p>They sat. Four soldiers settled into guard positions while the captain rode into a farther courtyard glimpsed through a magnificently carved archway.</p><p>"Look at the figures carved on the arch," whispered Eliar. "There is the sun in splendor, the moon veiled, and the stars assembled in ranks to acknowledge the suzerainty of the god they worship here."</p><p>" &#x2018;The god they worship here&#x2019;? That kind of talk will get you burned."</p><p>Eliar shrugged. "I&#x2019;m saying it to you. Not to them. What would they do? Force me to worship at their god&#x2019;s temple?"</p><p>"How na�ve are you? Don&#x2019;t you know anything about the empire? They could tell you...</p></p><h2>Money, Possessions, and Eternity</h2><p>A practical and comprehensive biblical study about money and possessions from a pastor&#39;s painstaking study and broad experience.</p><p>Who wants to settle for fleeting treasures on earth...<br> When God offers everlasting treasures in heaven? <p> It's time to rethink our perspectives on money and possessions.

Johnston </b>is recognized as a master of the American historical novel. His grand adventures of the American West combine the grace and beauty of a natural storyteller with complete dedication to historical accuracy and authenticity. Johnston was born on the first day of 1947 on the plains of Kansas, and lived all his life in the American West. His first novel, <i>Carry the Wind,</i> won the Medicine Pipe Bearer Award from the Western Writers of America, and his subsequent books have appeared on bestseller lists throughout the country. After writing more than thirty novels, he died in March 2001 in Millings, Montana.Although identified as the third book in a trilogy (after Carry the Wind and Borderloris), the final line in this volume reads: "This ain't the last you've heard of Titus Bass!" Bass is the hard-bitten, one-eyed "old" (40) trapper and mountain man who's befriended orphan Josiah Paddock. In 1833 they and their Indian wives, and Josiah's infant son, make their way to an idyllic spot in northern New Mexico, later moving on to Taos for the winter. Titus discovers that two ex-friends who stole his catch 10 years before are still alive and he sets out to wreak his revenge. Josiah travels with him to St. Louis where old M. LeClerc has plotted for years to avenge his son's death at Josiah's hands. The LeClerc tale has nice gothic possibilities but ends in soggy sentimentality. Despite much gory detail about skinning game, killing Indians (about three dozen of various tribes are dispatched) and minute descriptions of life in old St. Louis and on the frontier, the book founders under writing that is repetitious, fatuous and occasionally just bad: " . . . the annual affair came but once a year."

Here is a major rethinking of the American past with shocks of recognition for evervone today.</p><p>This classic of modern feminism is an ambitious attempt to trace certain present-day values back to cultural shifts of the 19th century. Historian Ann Douglas entwines the fate of American women, most notably those of the white middle class, with that of clergy marginalized by the rise in religious denominations and consequent dilution of their power base. No longer invited to wield influence in vital (some might say traditionally masculine) political and economic arenas, clergy were pushed toward more feminine spheres and rules of expression. Likewise, as growing numbers of middle-class white women lost their place as the indispensable center of household production, and many lower-class women became easily replaced industrial cogs, a none-too-subtle shift in perceptions about women's strengths and abilities occurred. Women lost voting rights and other legal privileges; barred from healing and midwifery, they were also less likely to appear in other increasingly male professions. Academies for wealthier girls imparted skills deemed to entice and soothe men without taxing supposedly tiny feminine brains; when Emma Willard offered geometry lessons to girls in the 1820s, one opponent harrumphed: "They'll be educating cows next." Douglas chronicles the rise of an overwhelmingly sentimental "feminization" of mass culture--in which writers of both sexes underscored popular convictions about women's weaknesses, desires, and proper place in the world--with erudite and well-argued scholarship. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>A modern classic by one of the leading feminist thinkers of our time, <i>The Feminization Of American Culture</i> has been continuously in print since its original publication more than fifteen years ago.

From the modern horrors of man - medical experiments, war - to the ancient power of the natural world,The Girl from Rawblood is not only a ghost story of the highest order, but a sublime meditation on the things that hold us captive: fidelity, fear, memory, love -- Leslie Parry, author of THE CHURCH OF MARVELS Brilliant -- RAWBLOOD is the old-school gothic novel I have been waiting for. While it delivers everything I want from a &#34;haunted house/family curse&#34; story it is still stunningly original. I have never read anything like it and that&#39;s saying something. -- Mike Mignola, creator of HELLBOY RAWBLOOD weaves a spell that both terrifies and mesmerizes. As each layer of mystery is peeled away, more haunting truth is revealed. The book leaves the reader breathless in its gothic tale of fear, family, blood, and love -- Simone St. James, author of THE HAUNTING OF MADDY CLARE Beautifully written Gothic.

Ward has crafted a sweeping saga of madness in all its forms that will chill you to the bones and draw you into its murky depths -- Charlie Lovett, author of &#39;The Bookman&#39;s Tale&#39; and &#39;First Impressions&#39; Beautifully written, in equal parts both terrifying and heart-breaking, RAWBLOOD is a dazzlingly brilliant Gothic masterpiece. Reminiscent of FRANKENSTEIN but better -- Sarah Pinborough, author of 13 MINUTES Rawblood makes a powerful contribution to the British literature of the fantastic. It&#39;s an epic family saga incorporating a great Gothic house, built upon a lyrically rendered regional landscape, from which the numinous rises as if it is a natural function of the setting. There&#39;s a touch of Ted Hughes here, Emily Bronte and M.R James in this eerie and by turns moving story that spans generations. It filled my head for several evenings, and will linger there too . . . A definite book of the year for me -- Adam Nevill, author of THE RITUAL an impressively hectic spin on the Gothic tradition * DAILY TELEGRAPH * carried off in fine style * LITERARY REVIEW * As a meta-examination of the Gothic genre (it&#39;s mostly set in the 19th Century( and as a straightforward tale of grisly haunting, Ward&#39;s novel is remarkably successful. * THE SPECTATOR * Chillingly good -- Charlotte Heathcote * Sunday Express S Magazine * plenty of twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat. * WOMAN AND HOME * The story crosses generations, from Victorian England to World War I, and is told by a number of different voices, going back and forth in time and drawing the reader into their thrall. With a ghostly face at the window, inexplicable events and a sense of menace hanging over every page, this is one chilling gothic novel -- Fanny Blake * Daily Mail * A gothic tale of love and madness, this atmospheric and chilling story drew me in from the first page, and kept me up at night, until I reached the last -- Claire Fuller, author of OUR ENDLESS NUMBERED DAYS Gloriously dark and claustrophobic, Rawblood is a haunting gothic novel of intelligence and complexity. It has many echoes of the classics but is entirely its own book. * Essie Fox, author of THE SOMNAMBULIST * From Victorian ghost story to anti-war polemic and back again: I raged, wept and hid under the bed covers. As full of science as it is the supernatural, this is a hauntingly brilliant virtuoso performance. -- Emma Healey author of ELIZABETH IS MISSING</p><h2>The rag coat</h2><p>With paintings that capture all the beauty of Appalachia in authentic detail, this tender story about a resourceful mountain girl&#39;s special coat will touchreaders with its affirming message of love and friendship.</p><p>Lauren Mills has won acclaim both as an author/illustrator and as a sculptor. Her work has been exhibited in museums and galleries across the country and her books have won awards including the Golden Kite Best Book Award and the Charlotte Award. The Rag Coat has also been performed as a ballet by the University of Utah.Grade 1-4-- Minna, a young Appalachian girl, wants very badly to attend school, but she doesn't have a coat. Her father has just died and her family cannot afford one. When a group of mothers who gather at her house regularly to make quilts hear of her predicament, they decide to help her. Minna is thrilled, but when the new coat is finished and she wears it to the one-room schoolhouse, she is teased by her classmates for wearing rags. Minna is hurt, but she eventually gains their interest when she explains that her coat is full of stories--their stories--for each scrap has come from one of their homes. The children are enthralled and sorry for their taunts. Mills's care and attention to details make her book as charming as her narrative. The paper is a cream color, and the watercolor palette is warm but faded to give an antique cast to the illustrations. The large, lovely paintings that bring the characters and period to life are balanced by text on the bottom half of the left-hand pages; the generous blank space is filled with small scraps of colorful cloth. The writing is lyrical; its heartwarming message emphasizes the value of a community and sharing. It might even inspire a class quilting project--and a chance to share more stories. --Judith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Religion of Jesus the Jew</h2><p>The Religion of Jesus the Jew [Paperback] [Nov 01, 1993] Vermes, Geza</p><p>This book completes a remarkable trilogy...

Stockman</b> was elected as a Michigan congressman in 1976, and joined the Reagan White House in 1981 as budget director. During nearly two decades at the Blackstone Group, where he was one of the early partners, and at Heartland Industrial Partners, a firm he founded, Stockman was a private equity investor. Born in Fort Hood, Texas, Stockman now lives in Connecticut. He is the author of <i>The Great Deformation: How Crony Capitalism Corrupted Free Markets and Democracy</i>.This memoir is a bitter review of Stockman's years in the Reagan Administration. It is a book with few heroes and many fools. The author claims naivete as his excuse. Although the narrative is somewhat confusing, overall, its backstage view of policymaking leaves one discouraged, even frightened by the superficiality. The book is a necessary library purchase for two reasons: the notoriety of the book and its author, and the insider's view of key policies still in place and key personalities still in power.

With her groundbreaking honest and passionate lyrics, her unusual and innovative rhythms and melody, Nyro's influence is still felt by singers and songwriters today.<br><br>Beginning with her childhood and teen years in the Bronx, and ending with her untimely death from ovarian cancer in 1997, <i>Soul Picnic </i>details how Nyro was "discovered" as a prodigious eighteen-year-old songwriter, had her songs covered with great success by other singers (most famously, the Fifth Dimension, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Three Dog Night, and Barbra Streisand), and created her own remarkable albums, such as <i>Eli and the Thirteen Confession </i>and <i>New York Tendaberry. </i>It also tells how a young David Geffen, as her agent and then manager, helped boost her career, but how she ultimately rejected both Geffen and the glare of stardom for a quieter rural life. Nyro was a very private person, and Michele Kort has uncovered aspects of her life offstage never previously revealed, including a romance with famed rock musician Jackson Browne and the love affair that led to the birth of her son, Gil. It also fleshes out her long, loving relationship with painter Maria Desiderio.<br><br>Kort features Laura Nyro's music, the making of each of her albums, the musical influences that informed her work, and the important legacy she has left behind. She interviewed nearly all of the producers and arrangers Nyro worked with, and many of the musicians who played on her albums. The book also includes a discography of both Nyro's recordings and many covers of her songs by well-known artists.<br><br>With passion and style, acclaimed journalist Michele Kort has seamlessly joined thorough research with oral history in this beautifully rendered biography of an important, often-overlooked music icon.<br></p><p>If you appreciate the music of the late 60s/early 70s, if you remember the songs the late great Laura Nyro wrote and others performed (&#34;Stoned Soul Picnic,&#34; &#34;Wedding Bell Blues,&#34; &#34;Eli&#39;s Comin&#39;,&#34; &#34;Stoney End,&#34; &#34;And When I Die,&#34; &#34;Sweet Blindness,&#34; &#34;Save the Country,&#34; &#34;Time and Love&#34; ...), and, most of all, if you love the way Nyro sang those songs, I think you&#39;ll enjoy this first-ever biography of the singer-songwriter. I spoke to over 100 people who knew and worked with Nyro over her 30-year music career, including her former manager David Geffen, Patti LaBelle (her backup singer, along with the group Labelle, on the &#34;Gonna Take A Miracle&#34; album), all her producers (such as the Rascals&#39; Felix Cavaliere), and her family and close friends. Plus, I gathered some great photos of her, from childhood on, including images with her family, her loves, and her musical colleagues. SOUL PICNIC is both a labor of love and a serious consideration of Nyro&#39;s music, career, and life, illuminating her roots as an artist while honoring her personal mystique.Los Angeles-based writer and editor Michele Kort has been a journalist for twenty-five years.

Their captors - fanatical Islamic slave traders - had declared war on the whole of Christendom. Thousands of Europeans had been snatched from their homes and taken in chains to the great slave markets of Algiers, Tunis and Sale in Morocco to be sold to the highest bidder. Pellow was bought by the tyrannical sultan of Morocco, who bragged that his white slaves enabled him to hold all of Europe to ransom. The sultan was constructing an imperial pleasure palace of enormous scale and grandeur, built entirely by Christian slave labour. Thomas Pellow was selected to be a personal slave of the sultan and he would witness first-hand the barbaric splendour of the imperial Moroccan court, as well as experience of daily terror. For 23 years, he would dream of his home, his family and freedom. He was one of the fortunate few who survived to tell his told. Drawn from unpublished letters and manuscripts written by slaves and by the padres and ambassadors sent to free them, this shocking and extraordinary story reveals a disturbing and forgotten chapter of our history.</p><p>Giles Milton is a writer and journalist.

His novel <i>Buddha�&#x2019;s Little Finger</i> was a finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. He is the winner of the Nonino Prize and the Richard- Schonfeld Prize for satire, and has been featured in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. His novels have been published in thirty-three countries.This unusual and thoughtful contemporary fantasy features A. Hu-Li, an ancient werefox in the shape of a teenage girl who works in Russia as a prostitute. She creates erotic, hypnotic illusions for her clients with her tail and feeds off the sexual energy they generate. Cassandra Campbell deftly inhabits the character of the sensual, cynical, playful, and lonely A. Hu-Li as she seeks enlightenment and unexpectedly finds love with a werewolf. Campbell also makes a wonderfully subtle point; her narration and conversations with other werefoxes are spoken in an American accent, but her dialogue to other Russians is delivered in a Russian accent, indicating that A. Hu-Li&#39;s true self remains hidden from the outside world.

Fables, fashions, and pastimes, rural life, animals, birds and insects--the subjects of her work are brought vividly to life in the superb color plates, and all the techniques and stitches she employs are explained in detail.</p><p>This is the third embroidery book by British textile artist Stevens (after The Embroiderer's Countryside, David &amp; Charles, 1992, and The Embroiderer's Country Album, David &amp; Charles, 1994). She excels in the naturalistic type of embroidery known as needlepainting. Worked in silk using several classic straight stitches, her flowers and animals are delicate and exquisite. This is not a book of projects but a clearly delineated album of Stevens's works with notes on technique in the accompanying text. As such, it is an inspiration to experienced needleworkers, proving a level of expertise and artistry rarely seen in modern embroidery books. Highly recommended for all decorative arts collections.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Stevens' third book is a meditation set within a broad historical context: from Saxon to modern times. The author begins her discussion with an explanation of the preferred design styles of Britain, her native country, which she follows with an examination of particular motifs. In every chapter there are innumerable pauses to scrutinize how to stitch different trees and leaves, fruits and animals, from the interstices of a pine cone to the black-and-white hairs of a badger family. Nature is her primary subject matter--and Stevens very graciously shows us its realistic and three-dimensional treatments in embroidery.

This first volume publishes every single panel strip from 1951-1952 in one handsome, thick&nbsp; volume.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Dennis the Menace</em> began on March 14, 1951 (four months after Ketcham's friend and colleague Charles Schulz started his own historic comic strip). He went on to become the second most popular cartoon kid in the world &#x2015; after Charlie Brown, of course. <em>Dennis the Menace</em> first appeared in 16 American newspapers; by the end of 1951, he was appearing in over a hundred.</p><p>The reason for Dennis' success is easy to figure out: It was one of the most brilliantly observed and empathetic comic strips about childhood ever drawn. Ketcham captured the mischievousness, rambunctiousness, and anarchy of a kid's world better than any other cartoonist. The strip appeals to both parents and children &#x2015; while parents shake their heads ruefully at how accurately Ketcham caught the essence of children's natural zest for mayhem, children identify with Dennis and the chaos that he leaves in his wake &#x2015; just a hop, skip, and a jump away from their own fantasy of themselves! Ketcham was a cartoonist with a vivacious line that was exquisitely suited to depicting adults and children. His gags were funny, subtle and touching.</p><p>Ketcham drew <em>Dennis the Menace</em> from 1951 to 1994, when he retired and let his assistant take over the strip. This first volume of <em>Hank Ketcham's Complete Dennis the Menace</em> publishes every single panel strip from 1951 and 1952 in one handsome and thick volume resembling a Big Little Book on steroids.</p> Black-and-white full-page panel cartoons throughout</p><p><p><strong>Hank Ketcham</strong> was born in 1920 and created <em>Dennis the Menace</em> in 1950.

He won a Caldecott Honor in 2012, and his illustrations have appeared in publications such as <em>Time</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, and many more.</p>Starred Review. Before there was Bart Simpson or Crayon Shinchan or Eric Cartman, there was Dennis the Menace, the five-year-old icon of childhood mischief. In this chronological collection of the long-running single panel strip, we see Dennis's skills with mud puddles, firecrackers, frogs and general mayhem developing at a splendid pace. <i>Dennis the Menace</i> stands out for both its chronicling of Baby Boom&#x2013;generation society, and its highly sophisticated humor. Ketcham's grace and economy of both art and punch line are superb, telling a complete story with a single line of dialogue. For instance, in one panel, Dennis's long-suffering parents sit in a friend's parlor as she calls up the stairs. "Bobby, you don't have to hide any more! They didn't bring Dennis! Bobby, can you hear Mother?" As the strips in this volume come to a close, Ketcham is still introducing his major players&#x2014;put-upon Mr. Wilson is only a small character, and female foils Margaret and Gina are still in their formative stages. As funny as the gags are, it's the art that captivates. As cartoonist Patrick McDonnell puts it in his intro, "Each meticulously designed panel was a masterpiece of composition." This beautifully produced book will delight for years to come. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Baby Blue Cat would rather roll in the mud with the dogs than play sweet cat games with his siblings. After one particularly dirty adventure, Mama Cat bathes Blue Cat while the Dirty Dog Brothers watch with fascination. Finally they try a bath and surprise themselves, and everyone else, with their true colors. Mama Cat rewards all with a batch of cookies and an invitation to come for a bath again. Cutesiness in both the writing and the illustrations hide what potential there is in the story line. Any self-respecting child will see through the sugar coating of this ploy to take a bath and will agree with the dogs who go off to the mud puddle as if to wash off Mama Cat's sweetness. Those attracted to the simple, colorful line drawings of the cats and dogs will be overwhelmed by the text. Nancy A. Gifford, Schenectady County Public Library, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although the other kittens prefer proper cat games, there is nothing Baby Blue Cat loves more than romping with the gloriously grimy Dog Brothers (whose coats are so filthy they are virtually indistinguishable). After a day with the two Dogs, Baby Blue Cat is a sight, and Mama Cat orders a bath. The Dogs decide to follow suittheir first baths yield impressive results indeed. Baby Blue Cat walks the proud, now-spanking pair homewhere all three find a mud puddle that beckons irresistibly. Pryor's first book displays a childlike sensibility; the animals' exuberance in their play, their delight in the textures and feel of dust and mud, and their utter unconcern with the results are portrayed with humor and charm in black-line illustrations washed in cottonball-colored blues and pinks.

The individual resident organizations that were the key constituents of Lincoln Center the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the New York Philharmonic, the Juilliard School, and eight others could not agree on a common capital plan or fundraising course of action. Instead, intramural rivalries and disputes filled the vacuum.<br><br>Besides, some of those organizations had daunting problems of their own. Levy tells the inside story of the demise of the New York City Opera, the Metropolitan Opera's need to use as collateral its iconic Chagall tapestries in the face of mounting operating losses, and the New York Philharmonic's dalliance with Carnegie Hall.<br><br>Yet despite these and other challenges, Levy and the extraordinary civic leaders at his side were able to shape a consensus for the physical modernization of the sixteen-acre campus and raise the money necessary to maintain Lincoln Center as the country's most vibrant performing arts destination. By the time he left, Lincoln Center had prepared itself fully for the next generation of artists and audiences.<br><br><i>They Told Me Not to Take That Job</i> is more than a memoir of life at the heart of one of the world's most prominent cultural institutions. It is also a case study of leadership and management in action. How Levy and his colleagues triumphantly steered Lincoln Center through perhaps the most tumultuous decade of its history to a startling transformation is fully captured in his riveting account.</p><p><b>Reynold Levy</b> was the president of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts from March 1, 2002 to January 31, 2014. He has held leadership roles at the International Rescue Committee, at AT&amp;T, and at the 92nd Street Y. He has taught at the Harvard Business School. Currently, he is an adjunct professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, a special advisor to the private equity firm General Atlantic, and a consultant to nonprofit institutions and foundations. He lives in New York City.Levy, with his persuasive and owlish mien, proved to be the administrative virtuoso Lincoln Center had been waiting for. No need to take his word for it. Just walk around. The campus today is what he and architect Elizabeth Diller said it would be, only busier, more open, more glamorous, more comfortable and more fun. If the renovation [of Lincoln Center] were a movie, its credit roll would run for 20 minutes, but it would be fair to call it a Reynold Levy production.&#x201d; <b><i>Vulture</i></b><br><br> Levy's unabashed enthusiasm for the non-profit arts helps us understand why a place like Lincoln Center is important, even in this profit-oriented era <i>They Told Me Not to Take that Job</i> provides a good, sometimes sad look at what the arts have been going through over the last couple of decades.&#x201d; <b><i>Maclean's</i></b><br><br> Reynold Levy has a rare blend of talents, all of which are on display in this compelling book, a memoir that is neither self-reverential nor full of false pieties. There is no bitterness, but there is surprising candor. Prominent people should be shamed, including those who nearly ran great cultural institutions into the ground. The lessons to be extracted could fuel an entire curriculum at the Harvard Business School, or a Department of Psychology.&#x201d; <b>Ken Auletta, bestselling author and writer for <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br><b><i>New York Times</i> bestseller</b><br><br> The most entertaining passages of the book chronicle the indefatigably upbeat Levy's fight to get a tangled web of stakeholders onboard with the project. He is unafraid to name the names of those who fought against the redevelopment [of Lincoln Center] at the beginning and he is refreshingly candid about what he perceives as the misguided policies of some of Lincoln Center's constituent organizations. it attests to the energy of his account and to the passion of his diagnoses of the Center's persistent, if alleviated, ills, that he pushes the reader into the future, projecting new problems and envisioning solutions.&#x201d; <b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Sure to make waves in the genteel world of New York's elite cultural institutions, where foes tend to exchange air kisses in public and keep their battles private. Mr. Levy's willingness to name names may not quite reach you'll-never-eat-lunch-in-this-town-again levels but could make for some awkward encounters at the chic Lincoln Ristorante.&#x201d; <b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p><h2>Declaration: The Nine Tumultuous Weeks When America Became Independent, May 1-July 4, 1776</h2><p>This is the rambunctious story of how America came to declare independence in Philadelphia in 1776. As late as that May, the Continental Congress had no plans to break away from England. Troops under General George Washington had been fighting the British for nearly a year&#x2014;yet in Philadelphia a mighty bloc known as "reconciliationists," led by the influential Pennsylvanian John Dickinson, strove to keep America part of the British Empire. <p>But a cadre of activists&#x2014;led by the mysterious Samuel Adams of Massachusetts and assisted by his nervous cousin John&#x2014;plotted to bring about American independence. Their audacious secret plan proposed overturning the reconciliationist government of Pennsylvania and replacing it with pro-independence leaders. Remarkably, the adventure succeeded. The Adams coalition set in motion a startling chain of events in the Philadelphia streets, in the Continental Congress, and throughout the country that culminated in the Declaration of Independence on July 4. </p><p>In <i>Declaration </i>William Hogeland brings to vibrant life both the day-to-day excitement and the profound importance of those nine fast-paced weeks essential to the American founding yet little known today. He depicts the strange-bedfellow alliance the Adamses formed with scruffy Philadelphia outsiders and elegant Virginia planters to demand liberty. He paints intimate portraits of key figures: John Dickinson, a patriot who found himself outmaneuvered on the losing side of history; Benjamin Franklin, the most famous man in America, engaged in and perplexed by his city&#x2019;s upheavals; Samuel Adams, implacable in changing the direction of Congress; his cousin John, anxious about the democratic aspirations of their rabble-rousing Philadelphia allies; and those democratic radical organizers themselves, essential to bringing about independence, all but forgotten until now. </p><p>As the patriots&#x2019; adventure gathers toward the world-changing climax of the Declaration, conflicts and ironies arise, with trenchant relevance for the most important issues confronting Americans today. <i>Declaration </i>offers a fresh, gripping, and vivid portrait of the passionate men and thrilling events that gave our country birth.</p></p><p><b>William Hogeland</b> has published in numerous print and online periodicals, including <i>The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly,</i> and <i>Slate.</i> He lives and writes in Brooklyn, New York.<b><b>1</b><br><br><b>Cold Wind, Warm Election</b></b> <p><b><i>May 1, 1776</i></b> </p><p>Voters kept arriving on Philadelphia&#x2019;s western outskirts. At the block of Chestnut Street between Fifth and Sixth streets, outside the door to the Pennsylvania State House, the men kicked up dust, a growing crowd of tricornered hats and winter-beaten coats. Soon they were trading insults and threats. It was Mayday of 1776, bright but cold, with a wind blowing from the Delaware River, and the polls had been open since ten in the morning for what one, a visitor, predicted would be &#x201c;the warmest election that ever was held in this city.&#x201d; The voters were choosing a new Pennsylvania government. The vote was expected to be close, the day tense and possibly even violent. The State House itself, assertively symmetrical in high Georgian style, spoke only of grace and stability. Cupolas adorned the bell tower, which drew gazes up and heads back as it pierced the sky. Big mechanical clocks celebrated Pennsylvania&#x2019;s leadership in science and technology. Words from Leviticus proclaimed liberty. In a light-suffused chamber on the ground floor one of the oldest deliberative bodies on the continent&#x2014;one of the best respected in the English-speaking world&#x2014;the Pennsylvania assembly, made laws. </p><p>But grace and stability hadn&#x2019;t been evident lately. The assemblymen had moved upstairs to a committee room. They were lending their regular room to the Continental Congress, a body of delegates representing the various American colonial governments. The body had gathered in Philadelphia in 1774 as the First Continental Congress to mount a formal, intercolonial resistance to trade and police policies of England. Colonial governments objected to those policies for violating liberties that Americans believed they were guaranteed by English law. Yet many colonists, in and out of government, objected to the colonies&#x2019; joining in opposition. Some deemed colonial resistance outright sedition. Delegates to the First Congress had fought bitterly over how far and how assertively to protest and resist. </p><p>Things had grown dire since then. Delegates to the Second Congress, which convened in Philadelphia in the spring of 1775, were now responsible for operating a poor excuse for a military force, optimistically called the Continental Army, which had actually gone to war against the British Army. The shooting had started in April 1775, when British regiments occupying Boston, Massachusetts, where American resistance had been especially confrontational, marched in formation out of town and into the nearby countryside. At Lexington and Concord, country militias confronted those ranks of crack redcoats and the soldiers were sent running back to Boston, harried by guerilla musketmen. With the British troops shocked and humiliated by defeat, militias from elsewhere in New England, and then from the other colonies, hastened to Massachusetts to aid what became a colonial siege, keeping the British occupiers stuck in Boston. In Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress gave firm support to Massachusetts by forming the Continental Army. The delegates sent George Washington, a Virginia militia colonel with few qualifications other than charisma and an impressive physique, up to Massachusetts to command the army and manage the siege. </p><p>Then, late in March, word had come to Philadelphia that the redcoats had burned their own forts and broken their own cannon, and had sailed their ships out of Boston Harbor. Things hadn&#x2019;t been entirely quiet since then. British ships had shelled and threatened coastal towns. Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia, now operating from a British warship, offered slaves freedom if they&#x2019;d rise up against their plantation masters. An American expedition to Quebec was in the process of failing. Only a few miles downriver from Philadelphia, two British men-of-war were tacking up and down the bay, patrolling the Delaware&#x2019;s mouth to stop the city&#x2019;s trade. </p><p>But there had been no invasion. Now that pause was over. The biggest armada in English history was forming, row on row of masts and sails mustering in the harbor at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and transport ships from England, sighted on the high seas, carrying thousands of soldiers, best disciplined in the world, expert at shaking curtains of lead from ranked muskets. Then they would charge, a thicket of blades, to slice bashed-up opponents into piles of gore. British retribution had been a year in the planning. It wouldn&#x2019;t be mild. </p><p>So the voters outside the Pennsylvania State House this cold Mayday had reason to be frightened and testy and ready to push and shove. The question they had to decide today, under pressures they could never have imagined before, was a terrible one: </p><p>Reconciliation with England? Or American independence? </p><p>Reconciliation had long been the watchword. The war against England was defensive: that was the position of the Continental Congress and the colonial governments it represented, as well as a fervent belief of many Americans, even patriots. Taking up arms had been justified, after years of Parliament&#x2019;s abuse, by British troops&#x2019; outright military aggression in Massachusetts. The war was supposed to make England see reason and bring Parliament to terms that would restore American liberties. Many colonists, including outspoken American resisters, referred to England as &#x201c;home&#x201d; and considered themselves loyal inhabitants of a glorious nation and great empire. They sought nothing more from the war than a quick conclusion and a just reconciliation with the mother country. </p><p>But some Americans had a different desire, and it was shocking: American independence. The idea had hardly been spoken aloud until recently. Its boldest adherents were from Massachusetts, which had always taken extreme positions against England; certain well-connected Virginians supported independence, too. In every colonial government and in the Continental Congress, the &#x201c;reconciliationists&#x201d; opposed the &#x201c;independents&#x201d; with force. Reconciliationists condemned declaring independence as a mad, doomed scheme of Massachusetts extremists. </p><p>No colony had been more committed to achieving reconciliation with England than Pennsylvania. And Pennsylvania made its opposition to independence decisive. Already called the keystone, rich and big, the Congress&#x2019;s host, it was the most influential of the colonies. Philadelphia&#x2019;s port on the Delaware dominated American trade, and the city was considered the second most important and elegant in the empire. A geographical position between New England and the South made Pennsylvania not only economically powerful but also militarily strategic, capable of fatally dividing Massachusetts from Virginia. And Pennsylvania held political sway over Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York, which formed a solid middle-colony bloc for reconciliation. Those colonies instructed their delegates in the Congress to pursue peace with England and to vote against any measure that might so much as hint at an American declaration of independence. Thanks to Pennsylvania&#x2019;s leadership, no effort in the Congress to push for independence could succeed. </p><p>But all that might change today. The Pennsylvania assembly was scheduled to begin its new session on May 20 in the temporary committee room upstairs. This election was for new Pennsylvania assemblymen, and a ticket of assembly candidates had announced their support for American independence. If those independence candidates could win a majority in the Pennsylvania assembly, the colony would reverse its policy for reconciliation almost overnight. The assembly would vote to change instructions to Pennsylvania&#x2019;s delegates in the Congress. So great was Pennsylvania&#x2019;s influence that an independence assembly elected here today could swing the whole Congress toward declaring independence and making the war a revolutionary one. </p><p>Hence the ugly mood. American independence or reconciliation with England? In an election that might determine Americans&#x2019; fate, there was no middle ground. The Continental Congress had taken an unaccustomed weekday recess, giving over the ground floor of the State House to receiving and recording Philadelphians&#x2019; ballots. Up and down the coast, people on both sides of the question awaited the results with fear and hope. As Pennsylvania went today, so must go the country, and the country was so passionately divided, and the contest in Pennsylvania so close, that nobody could confidently predict the outcome. </p><p>Samuel Adams of Boston was not to be seen at the polls that Mayday. He&#x2019;d done more than he hoped anyone would ever know to push the Pennsylvania election toward American independence. He made it his business to be anywhere but at the center of what he inspired. </p><p>He roomed with his second cousin John Adams near the Delaware River&#x2019;s loud docks. He&#x2019;d arrived in the spring of 1775, shortly after the shooting war had broken out at Lexington and Concord, entering Philadelphia in dour triumph. Muffled churchbells tolled to show the colonies&#x2019; support for his suffering Massachusetts. Most visitors were overwhelmed by the size, stink, and hustle of the busiest port in America and second-most-sophisticated city in the empire. Some marveled at the broad avenues on a rational grid. Not Samuel Adams. He found little to remark on and nothing to admire or approve in Philadelphia, in the province of Pennsylvania itself, or in the middle colonies as a whole. He&#x2019;d been called out of his New England country, and out of Boston&#x2019;s narrow alleys and turning streets, by a duty to make things like today&#x2019;s election go a certain way. Where he saw frippery and pusillanimity, a saving change must come. </p><p>Of what was called middling height (fairly short) and middling build (somewhat stocky), at fifty-three Adams was past middle age, and physical vigor had never been the source of his success. He was shaken by an intermittent, full-body tremor that sometimes...</p></p><h2>The Synonym Finder</h2><p>Oversize indexed hardcover with brown cover and gilt design.</p><p>The Last Word in Thesauruses<br>-- More than 1,000,000 synonyms<br>-- Simple alphabetical arrangement -- no separate index necessary<br>-- Separate subdivisions for the different parts of speech and different meanings of the same word<br>-- Expanded to include thousands of new words and expressions that have entered the language in recent years<br>-- Includes clearly labeled slang and informal words and expressions, as well as rare, archaic, scientific and other specialized terms<br>-- Minimum cross-referencesJ.I.

She remembers getting the anxious call from a friend from her past: "Meet me at the cabin. I've got evidence." She remembers seeing that friend lying in a pool of blood. And she remembers a horrifying glimpse of her lover Cole Dennis's face as a gunshot plunged her into darkness. Now, her memory and emotions scarred, Eve has returned to New Orleans to forget the past. But the past will not be forgotten. Eve's shattered memory has helped Cole walk on murder charges just as a new series of killings begins.<br>The latest murders are bizarre and baffling. The victims are killed in a ritual fashion, a series of numbers tattooed into their bodies. 212. 101. 111. 323. There is no clue to their meaning, no connection to the victims except one: Our Lady of Virtues Hospital, the crumbling old asylum that was once the scene of unspeakable madness. For Eve, it was a second home as a child. Her father was a doctor there, and she spent hours exploring its secret chambers, hidden rooms, and forbidden passageways. Somewhere in its decaying rooms lies the key to a terrible crime, a betrayal beyond imagining whose echoes are now being felt with a vengeance--a crime that seems to lead to Eve herself. And the only man she can trust with the search is Cole, her former lover and, just possibly, a cold-blooded killer.<br>As forgotten memories begin to surface, bodies are found and each twist leads to another terrifying piece of the puzzle. Someone is watching, planning, luring her back to the ruins of Our Lady and the shocking truths hidden there--someone who has been waiting for this moment to strike. He is deadlier than she could ever have imagined and closer than she knows. For the sins of the past must be revealed, the crimes brought to justice, and the price paid--in blood.</p><p><b>LISA JACKSON</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of over ninety-five novels, including <i>You Will Pay, After She&#x2019;s Gone,</i> <i>Deserves to Die,</i> <i>You Don&#x2019;t Want to Know,</i> <i>Running Scared,</i> and <i>Shiver</i>.

Mid-afternoon, and it was almost dark out there. The day had hardly been a day at all. A drop in temperature had brought the beginnings of a frost and Unity Street glittered beneath the street lights. The air had a kind of blue feel. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other four shops on the parade were already closed but he had put on the lava lamps and the electric fire. The music shop was warm and colourfully lit. At the counter, Maud the tattooist stood flicking through fanzines while Father Anthony made an origami flower. Saturday Kit had collected all the Emmylou Harris and was trying to arrange them in alphabetical order without Frank noticing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I had no customers again,&#x2019; said Maud, very loud. Even though Frank was at the back of the shop and she was at the front, there was technically no need to shout. The shops on Unity Street were only the size of a front room. &#x2018;Are you listening?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m listening.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t look like you&#x2019;re listening.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank took off his headphones. Smiled. He felt laugh lines spring all over his face and his eyes crinkled at the corners. &#x2018;See? I&#x2019;m always listening.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maud made a noise like &#x2018;<i>Ham</i>.&#x2019; Then she said, &#x2018;One man called in, but it wasn&#x2019;t for a tattoo. He just wanted directions to the new precinct.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Anthony said he&#x2019;d sold a paperweight in his gift shop. Also, a leather bookmark with the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer stamped on it. He seemed more than happy about that. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;If it stays like this, I&#x2019;ll be closed by summer.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You won&#x2019;t, Maud. You&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x2019; They had this conversation all the time. She said how awful things were, and Frank said they weren&#x2019;t, Maud, they weren&#x2019;t. You two are like a stuck record, Kit told them, which might have been funny except that he said it every night, and besides, they weren&#x2019;t a couple. Frank was very much a single man.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Do you know how many funerals the undertakers have had?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, Maud.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;<i>Two</i>. Two since Christmas. What&#x2019;s wrong with people?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Maybe they&#x2019;re not dying,&#x2019; suggested Kit. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Of course they&#x2019;re dying. People don&#x2019;t come here any more. All they want is that crap on the high street.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only last month the florist had gone. Her empty shop stood on one end of the parade like a bad tooth, and a few nights ago the baker&#x2019;s window &#x2013; he was at the other end &#x2013; had been defaced with slogans. Frank had fetched a bucket of soapy water but it took all morning to wash them off.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;There have always been shops on Unity Street,&#x2019; said Father Anthony. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re a community. We belong here.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday Kit passed with a box of new twelve-inch singles, narrowly missing a lava lamp. He seemed to have abandoned Emmylou Harris. &#x2018;We had another shoplifter today,&#x2019; he said, apropos of not very much atall. &#x2018;First he flipped because we had no CDs. Then he asked to look at a record and made a run for it.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What was it this time?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Genesis. <i>Invisible Touch.</i>&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What did you do, Frank?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Oh, he did the usual,&#x2019; said Kit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Frank had done the sort of thing he always did. He&#x2019;d grabbed his old suede jacket and loped after the young man until he caught him at the bus stop. (What kind of thief waited for the number 11?) He&#x2019;d said, between deep breaths, that he would call the police unless the lad came back and tried something new in the listening booth. He could keep the Genesis record if he wanted the thing so much, though it broke Frank&#x2019;s heart that he was nicking the wrong one &#x2013; their early stuff was tons better. He could have the album for nothing, and even the sleeve; &#x2018;so long as you try &#x201c;Fingal&#x2019;s Cave&#x201d;. If you like Genesis, trust me. You&#x2019;ll love Mendelssohn.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I wish you&#x2019;d think about selling the new CDs,&#x2019; said Father Anthony.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Are you joking?&#x2019; laughed Kit. &#x2018;He&#x2019;d rather die than sell CDs.&#x2019;<br> Then the door opened and <i>ding-dong</i>; a new customer. Frank felt a ping of excitement. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tidy, middle-aged man followed the Persian runner that led all the way to the turntable. Everything about this man seemed ordinary &#x2013; his coat, his hair, even his ears &#x2013; as if he had been deliberately assembled so that no one would look at him twice. Head bowed, he crept past the counter to his right, where Maud stood with Father Anthony and Kit, and behind them all the records stored in cardboard master bags. <br> He passed the old wooden shelving to his left, the door that led up to Frank&#x2019;s flat, the central table, and all the plastic crates piled with surplus stock. Not even a sideways glance at the patchwork of album sleeves and homemade posters thumbtacked by Kit all over the walls. At the turntable, he stopped and pulled out a handkerchief. His eyes were red dots.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Are you all right?&#x2019; Frank asked, in his boom of a voice. &#x2018;How can I help you today?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The thing is, you see, I only like Chopin.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank remembered now. This man had come in a few months ago. He had been looking for something to calm his nerves before his wedding. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You bought the <i>Nocturnes</i>,&#x2019; he said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man wriggled his mouth. He didn&#x2019;t seem used to the idea that anyone would remember him. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got myself in another spot of difficulty. I wondered if you might &#x2013; find something else for me?&#x2019; He had missed a patch on his chin when he was shaving. There was some�thing lonesome about it, that scratchy patch of stubble, all on its own.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Frank smiled because he always smiled when a customer asked for help. He asked the same questions he always asked. Did the man know what he was looking for? (Yes. Chopin.) Had he heard anything else that he liked? (Yes. Chopin.) Could he hum it? (No. He didn&#x2019;t think he could.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man shot a look over his shoulder to make sure no one was listening but they weren&#x2019;t. Over the years, they&#x2019;d seen everything in the music shop. There were the regular customers, of course, who came to find new records, but often people wanted something more. Frank had helped them through illness, grief, loss of confidence and jobs, as well as the more everyday things like football results and the weather. Not that he knew about all those things but really it was a matter of listen�ing, and he had endless patience. As a boy, he could stand for hours with a piece of bread in his hand, hoping for a bird. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the man was gazing at Frank. He was waiting. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You just want me to find you the right record? You don&#x2019;t know what, but so long as it&#x2019;s Chopin, you&#x2019;ll be OK?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Yes, yes,&#x2019; said the man. That was it exactly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what did he need? Frank pushed away his fringe &#x2013; it flopped straight back, but there it was, the thing had a life of its own &#x2013; he cupped his chin in his hands and he listened as if he were trying to find a radio signal in the ether. Something beautiful? Something slow? He barely moved, he just listened. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when it came, it was such a blast, it took Frank&#x2019;s breath away. Of course. What this man needed wasn&#x2019;t Chopin. It wasn&#x2019;t even a nocturne. What he needed was&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Wait!&#x2019; Frank was already on his feet. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lumbered around the shop, tugging out album sleeves, skirting past Kit, and ducking his head to dodge a light fitting. He just needed to find the right match for the music he had heard from the man who only liked Chopin. Piano, yes. He could hear piano. But the man needed something else as well. Something that was both tender and huge. Where would Frank find that? Beethoven? No, that would be too much. Beethoven might just floor a man like this one. What he needed was a good friend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Can I help you, Frank?&#x2019; asked Kit. Actually he said &#x2018;Ca&#x2019; I hel&#x2019;?&#x2019; because his eighteen-year-old mouth was full of chocolate biscuit. Kit wasn&#x2019;t simple or even backward, as people sometimes suggested, he was just gauche and wildly overenthusiastic, raised in a small suburban house by a mother with dementia and a father who mainly watched television. Frank had grown fond of Kit in the last few years, in the way that he had once cared for his broken van and his mother&#x2019;s record player. He found that if you treated him like a young terrier, sending him out for regular walks and occupying him with easy tasks, he was less liable to cause serious damage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what was the music he was looking for? What was it?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank wanted a song that would arrive like a little raft and carry this man safely home. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Piano. Yes. Brass? That could work. A voice? Maybe. Something powerful and passionate that could sound both complicated and yet so simple it was obvious&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was it. He got it. He knew what the man needed. He swung behind the counter and pulled out the right record. But when he rushed back to his turntable, mumbling, &#x2018;Side two, track five. This is it. Yes, this is the one!&#x2019; the man gave a sigh that was almost a sob it was so desperate. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No, no. Who&#x2019;s this? Aretha Franklin?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;&#x201c;Oh No Not My Baby<i>&#x201d;</i>. This is it. This is the song.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;But I told you. I want Chopin. Pop isn&#x2019;t going to help.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Aretha is <i>soul</i>. You can&#x2019;t argue with Aretha.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;<i>Spirit in the Dark</i>? No, no. I don&#x2019;t want this record. It&#x2019;s not what I came for.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank looked down from his great height, while the man twisted and twisted his handkerchief. &#x2018;I know it&#x2019;s not what you want, but trust me, today it&#x2019;s what you need. What have you got to lose?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man sent one last look in the direction of the door. Father Anthony gave a sympathetic shrug, as if to say, <i>Why not? We&#x2019;ve all been there. </i>&#x2018;Go on, then,&#x2019; said the man who only liked Chopin. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kit sprang forward and led him to a listening booth, not exactly holding his hand, but leading the way with outstretched arms as if parts of the man were in danger of dropping off at any moment. Light bloomed from the lava lamps in shifting patterns of pink and apple-green and gold. The booths were nothing like the ones in Woolworths &#x2013; those were more like standing up in a hairdryer. Their headphones were so greasy, Maud said, you had to shower afterwards. No, these booths Frank had made himself from a pair of matching Victorian wardrobes of incredible magnitude he had spotted in a skip. He had sawn off the feet, removed the hanging rails and sets of drawers, and drilled small holes to connect each one with cable to his turntable. Frank had found two armchairs, small enough to fit inside, but comfortable. He had even polished the wood until it gleamed like black gloss paint, revealing a delicate inlay in the doors of mother-of-pearl birds and flowers. The booths were beautiful when you really looked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man stepped in and made a sideways shuffle &#x2013; there was very little space; he was being asked to sit in a piece of bedroom furniture, after all &#x2013; and took his place. Frank helped with the headphones and shut the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Are you all right in there?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;This won&#x2019;t work,&#x2019; the man called back. &#x2018;I only like Chopin.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his turntable, Frank eased the record from its sleeve and lifted the stylus. <i>Tick, tick </i>went the needle, riding the grooves. He flicked the speaker switch so that it would play through the whole shop. <i>Tick, tick&#x2014;</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vinyl had a life of its own.

It&#x2019;s the <i>Normandie,</i> and word on the street is that it was burned by German saboteurs. &#x201c;Ten lousy minutes in New York and already his new life felt as full of loss and betrayal as the one he&#x2019;d left behind.&#x201d; <br><br>What he left behind in a small North Carolina town was a wife who&#x2019;d left him, a daughter in the care of his sister, and a career as a police officer marred by questions surrounding his partner&#x2019;s murder. When he gets a job with the NYPD, he wants to believe it&#x2019;s the beginning of a new life, though he suspects that the past is as tenacious as &#x201c;a parasite in the bloodstream.&#x201d; <br><br>It&#x2019;s on the job that Cain comes in contact with a man who calls himself Danziger. He has the appearance of a &#x201c;crackpot,&#x201d; but he speaks five languages, has the manners of a man of means and education&#x2014;and he appears to be the one person who can help Cain identify a body just found floating in the Hudson River. But who exactly is Danziger? He&#x2019;s a writer of letters for illiterate immigrants on Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East Side&#x2014;&#x201c;a steadfast practitioner of concealing and forgetting&#x201d; for his clients, and perhaps for himself: he hints at a much more worldly past. What and whoever he really is or has been, he has a seemingly boundless knowledge of the city and its denizens. And he knows much more than the mere identity of the floating corpse. For one thing, he knows how the dead man was involved in New York City&#x2019;s &#x201c;Little Deutschland,&#x201d; where swastikas were proudly displayed just months before. And he also seems to know how the investigation will put Cain&#x2014;and perhaps his daughter and the woman he&#x2019;s fallen for&#x2014;in harm&#x2019;s way. But even Danziger can&#x2019;t know that the more he and Cain investigate, the nearer they come to the center of a citywide web of possibly traitorous corruption from which neither of them may get out alive.</p><p><b>DAN FESPERMAN</b>'s&nbsp;travels as a journalist and novelist have taken him to thirty countries and three war zones. <i>Lie in the Dark</i> won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association of Britain&#x2019;s John Creasey Memorial Dagger Award for best first crime novel, <i>The Small Boat of Great Sorrows </i>won their Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller, and <i>The Prisoner of Guant�namo </i>won the Dashiell Hammett Award from the International Association of Crime Writers.<br> &nbsp;<br> www.danfesperman.com1<br><br>First day on the job, half an hour left on his shift, when the call came in. There was a body in the Hudson, down by the docks at the end of 30th. Captain Mulhearn wore a big crooked smile as he carried the sheet over to Woodrow Cain&#x2019;s desk, like he was delivering a housewarming gift to a neighbor he didn&#x2019;t particularly like.<br><br>&#x201c;All yours, Southern Boy. Welcome to the third district, and enjoy your night on the town.&#x201d;<br><br>Twenty minutes later, his left thigh stiff after sitting all day, Cain limped carefully through the dark, crossing railroad ties and wet cobbles, and then stepping beneath the trestled gloom of Twelfth Avenue as he approached the muted shimmer of the waterfront.<br><br>Just ahead were two uniformed cops in silhouette, illuminated dimly by the twinkle of Hoboken on the far shore. They were talking, hands in motion, not yet aware of his presence.<br><br>Cain stopped to listen.<br><br>&#x201c;I say we poke him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poke him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Toward downtown, with a stick. One of those things with a crook on it, like the swabbies use.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A boat hook? Where we gonna find a boat hook?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, so maybe we throw something. Make enough waves so he gets pushed back into the current at the end of the pier. Presto, he floats on down to the tenth. Then he&#x2019;s their problem.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It don&#x2019;t work that way. Besides, what if the tide&#x2019;s coming in? Then he floats uptown a couple blocks and we&#x2019;ve turned a one-�hour job into a whole night&#x2019;s headache, and I&#x2019;m freezing my ass off as it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whadda you mean, &#x2018;tide&#x2019;? It&#x2019;s a fucking river. It&#x2019;s upstream or downstream, and the tenth is downstream.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With a tide, numbnuts. Besides, he&#x2019;s bumping the wharf, so he&#x2019;s already ours. It&#x2019;s in the Manual of Procedure. &#x2018;Cases Occurring on Piers, Boats, and Navigable Waters.&#x2019; Jurisdiction depends on which bulkhead or pier the body comes to rest on.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain stepped forward, looming up out of the shadows like a ghost. The cop advocating the boat hook strategy jumped like he&#x2019;d been goosed, while the one on the right reached for his sidearm.<br><br>&#x201c;At ease, gentlemen.&#x201d; Cain flashed his brand new shield. He recognized the patrolman on the right from the station house. &#x201c;Officer Petrowski is correct. Article 7 from the manual. It was a question on the sergeant&#x2019;s exam.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They made you take that? I heard you was a charity hire.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Made me take all kinds of tests. So what have we got?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Floater. Have a look.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain peered down from the bulkhead. Bottles and trash formed an atoll around a man&#x2019;s body, facedown in the dark water. Fully clothed, but bloated tightly in a T-�shirt and work pants, like a roasting sausage ready to burst its casing with a pop and a sizzle. The smell of dead fish, boat fuel, and putrefaction wafted up to him in the gloom. Something rippled the water from just beneath the surface, a carp or a swimming rodent, nosing around the body. Bile surged to the base of his throat. He swallowed to keep it down, leaving a sour burn. Then he stepped back, took a deep breath. Petrowski and the other cop were talking again.<br><br>&#x201c;You gettin&#x2019; that smell?&#x201d; the first one asked.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you expect?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Like something burning. You smell that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Normandie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be. That was, what, two months ago?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she&#x2019;s still there, laying on her side. Burnt stuff really holds its stink, and it&#x2019;s less than twenty blocks away. So when the wind&#x2019;s right . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;See? It&#x2019;s blowing south. If we&#x2019;d just pushed him out far enough&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Cain interrupted. &#x201c;Did y&#x2019;all call the morgue?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fifteen minutes ago,&#x201d; Petrowski said. &#x201c;Said they were on their way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I need y&#x2019;all to secure the area.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing down here this time of night but bums and railroad bulls.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then keep the bums and bulls away. Split up, one to either side.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>They headed off in the same direction, Cain shaking his head at the insolence. He began counting to ten under his breath while they resumed their conversation in lowered tones.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Y&#x2019;all.&#x2019; You get that? Said it twice, like he&#x2019;s from Dogpatch in the funny papers. So what did the krauts put in it to make it burn like that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Normandie? That wasn&#x2019;t the krauts. It was a dumb fuck welder with an acetylene torch. Threw a spark on some packing straw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Likely story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was in the papers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like I said. If&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Cain shouted.<br><br>The cops froze.<br><br>&#x201c;You guys forget how to secure a scene? One to either side. Now split up and get moving!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Petrowski answered.<br><br>&#x201c;New guy who don&#x2019;t know shit,&#x201d; the other one grumbled. &#x201c;Already throwing his weight around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got a rabbi.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Figures.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His father-�in-�law is what I hear. Some white-�shoe asshole on Wall Street.&#x201d;<br><br>Second time today he&#x2019;d overheard a cop muttering about his rabbi. Cain was Baptist, and his father-�in-�law was Episcopal, but the meaning was obvious enough. A ward heeler, a political hack. A guy who called in favors from the powers that be. Obviously his new colleagues had found out that Cain&#x2019;s father-�in-�law, Harris Euston, a partner with a patrician law firm on Wall Street, had put in a word for him.<br><br>True enough, but it rankled all the same. Probably explained why everyone at the station house had been so standoffish. A few nods and hellos, not a whole lot more. He supposed he understood. Half the cops on the force seemed to be studying for the sergeant&#x2019;s exam, trying to climb the next rung on the ladder, to the level he&#x2019;d already reached. He&#x2019;d heard them firing questions back and forth in the break room while he ate his lunch alone, a ham sandwich with a Lucky for dessert, everyone acting like he was invisible. Although later Captain Mulhearn had said something about going out for beers next week, first round on him, like it was a rite of passage. So there was that to look forward to, he supposed.<br><br>The dimmed headlights of the meat wagon crept toward Cain down 30th, past the high brick walls of the Stanley Soap Works. Two men hopped out, equipped with netting and what looked like a pair of giant tongs. They got to work like it was no big deal, an everyday occurrence. Maybe it was.<br><br>For Cain it was a milestone&#x2014;�his first corpse in New York. He&#x2019;d come across only one other floater, years ago, similarly bloated. A poor soul who&#x2019;d snagged on a fallen tree in the Neuse River. Presumed drowned, until they rolled him over and saw the damage from a shotgun blast. Pellets of lead had remained lodged in his skin even as his chest wheezed out the sump of the river like a broken accordion. It took a week to make an ID, but Cain never solved it, and so far this one looked equally promising.<br><br>Cain had never grown accustomed to the gore and grief of homicides, but he was passionate about working them. Unsolved cases never faded over time. Like debts, they accrued interest and weighed on his mind. He was not particularly religious, but whenever he contemplated an afterlife he imagined being accosted from the moment he arrived by everyone whose murder he&#x2019;d never closed, and who wanted to begin eternity like that?<br><br>Within minutes the guys from the morgue had maneuvered the body onto the dock next to a giant pile of coal. They flipped him onto his back, which made a slapping noise like a landed fish. The eye sockets were empty. Foul gases erupted from the open mouth along with a gray stream of water that rolled down his cheeks like spilled gravy.<br><br>Cain swallowed fast and breathed through his mouth. He stepped forward for a closer look.<br><br>A pink scar ran diagonally across the man&#x2019;s forehead toward a big dent in the cranium. Someone had bashed him hard enough to either kill him or knock him cold. Cain wondered if the man had still been alive when he hit the water. He imagined a body falling from way up on the George Washington Bridge, miles north of here, an impact which surely would&#x2019;ve finished the job. But that seemed like a dumb place to dispose of a body&#x2014;�too showy, nothing that a professional would do. They&#x2019;d use a boat, although a thorough practitioner would&#x2019;ve also weighted the body to make it sink. Unless he was in too much of a hurry. Perhaps he&#x2014;�or they&#x2014;�had been interrupted, or were new to the business. Not that Cain knew much about how the murder business worked up here.<br><br>He reached into an overcoat pocket and withdrew a dog-�eared steno pad, the latest in a series dating to his first days on the job back in Horton. The NYPD had given him an official one&#x2014;�a memo book, Mulhearn called it&#x2014;�but Cain preferred his old one, maybe because he used them for more than just work. Scribbled on pages between the case notes were grocery lists, nature sketches, birthday reminders, a bad poem or two. Having all those things in the same place made his life feel more stitched together, which seemed more important than ever now that almost everything else had fallen apart. Although he&#x2019;d always wondered what the consequences would be if his notebook ever got entered into evidence&#x2014;�all those private musings and observations, laid out for judge and jury. His life in miniature, scarred by bullet points, cross-�outs, and erasures. Cain on the page was a mess, barely legible.<br><br>&#x201c;Anything in his back pockets?&#x201d;<br><br>They shrugged.<br><br>&#x201c;Heave him back over.&#x201d;<br><br>They looked at each other for a second, then did as he asked, uncorking more gases, a cold smell of mud, the sediment of centuries from the bottom of the Hudson. Cain crouched and slid his hand into the man&#x2019;s front right trouser pocket, wet and tight.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; one of the morgue guys said. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be doin&#x2019; that.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain pried loose a stick of gum, still in its wrapper. Stuck to it was a sodden ticket stub from a movie theater, the print faintly legible. Nothing else. He stood and wrote down the details.<br><br>&#x201c;Pull up his shirt.&#x201d;<br><br>They hesitated, gave him a look.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon. The sleeves, too.&#x201d;<br><br>On the man&#x2019;s chest there was a scatter of a dozen or so small black circles&#x2014;�cigarette burns? Cain had once seen them on the body of a child, a memory that made him pause in his writing. On the man&#x2019;s right shoulder was a small, crude tattoo of a woman&#x2019;s name in cursive, &#x201c;Sabine.&#x201d; Otherwise, there was nothing that might identify him. Someone at the morgue would take his fingerprints, but without a name to go on there would be no way to make a match with the thousands upon thousands that were on file.<br><br>&#x201c;Not carrying any ID, huh?&#x201d; one of the morgue guys asked.<br><br>Cain shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Another John Doe, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You get a lot of those?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ninth this week. Maybe seven hundred a year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven hundred?&#x201d; Cain shifted his weight to keep his bad leg from stiffening. &#x201c;What happens to them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With most of &#x2019;em, some friend or relative comes by in a week or two, stakes a claim, gives &#x2019;em a decent burial. If not, we keep &#x2019;em three months. Then it&#x2019;s off to City Island, up in the Bronx.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A potter&#x2019;s field?&#x201d;<br><br>The guy nodded. &#x201c;Big damn place. More than a hundred thousand. Stinks to high heaven.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain shook his head in amazement. That was more populous than any city in his home state. He took out a handkerchief and blew his nose, the gases lingering in his nostrils. He knew from experience that his overcoat would smell this way in the morning. To him, at least.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take it from here unless you need to see more. Our pencil pusher will be around with some papers to sign.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain nodded and stepped toward the bulkhead, where he cleared his throat and spit into the water, which again rippled from below, some creature rising to inspect the latest contribution. He pulled out his pack of Luckies, the flare of the match flashing on the river as he inhaled deeply, a small moment of tribute to his home state. Bright leaf tobacco, like his dad used to grow. Cain had once helped hang it, leaf by leaf, in big barns in the fields east of Horton, where the smell of curing fires had been as much a part of fall as carved pumpkins and college football.<br><br>A guy walked up out of the darkness, notebook in hand.<br><br>&#x201c;You handling this?&#x201d;<br><br>Cain nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Got an ID yet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Nothing in his pockets but a gum wrapper and a ticket stub.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Beemans?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The gum wrapper.&#x201d;<br><br>He consulted his notebook. &#x201c;Blackjack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Big blow to the head, looked like. A bunch of small marks on his chest, you&#x2019;ll see &#x2019;em. Cigarette burns, if I had to guess. A small tattoo on his right shoulder with a name, Sabine.&#x201d;<br><br>He asked Cain to spell it, so he did.<br><br>&#x201c;Cause of death?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thought that was your department?&#x201d;<br><br>The guy smiled, kept scribbling.<br><br>&#x201c;What about the stub? Ballgame?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some movie theater on 96th.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The one up in Yorkville?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s either been in the drink a while, or never did his laundry. That joint&#x2019;s been closed since December. Kraut hangout. Shut down right after Pearl. The whole neighborhood&#x2019;s kraut.&#x201d;<br><br>The guy scribbled for a few seconds more, then asked another question.<br><br>&#x201c;And your name is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Woodrow Cain. Detective sergeant, third division.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kane with a K, like the movie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With a C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like Cain and Abel?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In name only. Woodrow as in Wilson.&#x201d;<br><br>Officer Petrowski ambled up.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Cain. The morgue guy is here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got it covered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, dunce, back over by the body. You ain&#x2019;t talking to this jackal, I hope?&#x201d; He scowled and drifted back into the night.<br><br>&#x201c;Who the hell are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sam Willett, Daily News.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that official?&#x201d;<br><br>Cain frowned and gave him a pleading look that said Go easy. In return he got a look that said Fat chance.<br><br>&#x201c;New, huh? And not from around here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Scram, will you? Before I get in any deeper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay by me. Got all I need.&#x201d; Willett shut his notebook. &#x201c;Good stuff on the cigarette burns. Sounds like somebody really worked him over. Decent bet he&#x2019;s German, which should get me a few column inches. Be seeing you.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain tossed his cigarette toward the water and went off to find the morgue guy, a tall fellow as pale as a cadaver with a personality to match. He looked up from a clipboard and gave Cain a fisheye, head to toe.<br><br>&#x201c;Word to the wise, Bud. Never, repeat never, have my people rearrange clothing or go fishing around in pockets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Cain, Bud. And I did the pockets myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Duly noted. Will you be doing the autopsy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a cutter. This&#x2019;ll be Doc Bolton&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How &#x2019;bout a favor, then? Tell Bolton that in addition to the usual items I&#x2019;d like an estimate on how old the tattoo is. The one on the right shoulder that says Sabine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Duly noted. But put it in writing, then sign these. Plus your initials on that box down at the bottom that says you disturbed the corpse. Bud.&#x201d;<br><br>Cain wrote his request and signed what he had to. He sent Petrowski and the other cop home, and lit another smoke as the meat wagon pulled away. By then the reporter was gone, and things got quiet in a hurry. Nothing but the slap of the river against the bulkheads, the low roar of passing traffic up on the viaduct. Further down the waterfront you could hear hammering, a twinkle of industry, the war effort still lumbering to its feet. He stared into the murk. If his name ended up in the papers they&#x2019;d probably think he was grandstanding, already playing to the crowd. Too late now.<br><br>For all his zeal in murder cases, they&#x2019;d never been a big part of the job in Horton&#x2014;�three or four per year, six at the most. Maybe that&#x2019;s why they stayed with him.

He sat on a cold, damp rock inside the remains of the isolated Irish stone cottage where the long summer had started with a beautiful woman, a tale of magic and fairies&#x2014;and a killer obsessed with his own ideas of good and evil.<br><br>The autumn equinox had passed. Summer was over. Scoop told himself it was a new beginning, but he had unfinished business. It'd been gnawing at him ever since he'd regained consciousness in his Boston hospital room a month ago, after a bomb blast had almost killed him.<br><br>He was healed. It was time to go home and get back to work. Be a cop again.<br><br>He set his water bottle back in his pack and zipped up the outer compartment. A solitary ray of sunshine penetrated the tangle of vines above him where once there'd been a thatched roof. He could hear the rush of the stream just outside the ruin.<br><br>And water splashing. Scoop shifted position on the rock, listening, but there was no doubt. Someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;was tramping in the stream that wound down from the rocky, barren hills above Kenmare Bay. He hadn't seen anyone on his walk up from the cottage where he was staying on a quiet country lane.<br><br>He stood up. He could hear laughter now.<br><br>A woman's laughter.<br><br>Irish fairies, maybe? Out here on the southwest Irish coast, on the rugged Beara Peninsula, he could easily believe fairies were hiding in the greenery that grew thick on the banks of the stream.<br><br>He stepped over fallen rocks to the opening that had served as the only entrance to what once had been someone's home. He could feel a twinge of pain in his hip where shrapnel had cut deep when the bomb went off at the triple-decker he owned with Bob O'Reilly and Abigail Browning, two other Boston detectives. He had taken most of the blistering shards of metal and wood in the meatier parts of his back, shoulders, arms and legs, but one chunk had lodged in the base of his skull, making everyone nervous for a day or so. A millimeter this way or that, and he'd be dead instead of wondering if fairies were about to arrive at his Irish ruin for a visit.<br><br>He heard more water splashing and more female laughter.<br><br>"I know, I know." It was a woman, her tone amused, her accent American. "Of <em>course </em>I'd run into a big black dog up here in these particular hills."<br><br>In his two weeks in Ireland, Scoop had heard whispers about a large, fierce black dog occasionally turning up in the pastures above the small fishing and farming village. He'd seen only sheep and cows himself.<br><br>He peered into the gray mist. The morning sun was gone, at least for the moment. He'd learned to expect changeable weather. Brushed by the Gulf Stream, the climate of the Southwest was mild and wet, but he'd noticed on his walks that the flowers of summer were fading and the heather on the hills was turning brown.<br><br>"Ah." The woman again, still out of sight around a sharp bend in the stream. "You're coming with me, are you? I must be very close, then. Lead the way, my new friend."<br><br>The ruin was easy to miss amid the dense trees and undergrowth on the banks of the stream. If he hadn't known where to look, Scoop would have gone right past it his first time out here.<br><br>A woman with wild, dark red hair ducked under the low-hanging branches of a gnarly tree. Ambling next to her in the shallow water was, indeed, a big black dog.<br><br>The woman looked straight at Scoop, and even in the gray light, he saw that she had bright blue eyes and freckles&#x2014;a lot of freckles. She was slim and angular, her hair down to her shoulders, damp and tangled. She continued toward him, the dog staying close to her. She didn't seem particularly taken aback by finding a man standing in the doorway of the remote ruin. Scoop wouldn't blame her if she did. Even before the bomb blast, he had looked, according to friends and enemies alike, ferocious with his thick build, shaved head and general take-no-prisoners demeanor.<br><br>For sure, no one would mistake him for a leprechaun or a fairy prince.<br><br>Her left foot sank into a soft spot and almost ended up in the water. Mud stains came to the top of her wellies. "I saw footprints back there," she said cheerfully, pointing a slender hand in the direction she'd just come. "Since I've never run into a cow or a sheep that wears size-twelve shoes, I figured someone else was out here. A fine day for a walk, isn't it?"<br><br>"It is," Scoop said.<br><br>"I don't mind the outbreaks of rain." She tilted her head back, letting the mist collect on her face a moment, then smiled at him. "I don't do well in the sun."<br><br>Scoop stepped down from the threshold and nodded to the dog, still panting at her side. "Yours?"<br><br>"No, but he's a sweetheart. I suppose he could be aggressive if he or someone he cared about felt threatened."<br><br>A warning? Scoop noticed she wore a rain jacket the same shade of blue as her eyes and held an iPhone in one hand, perhaps keeping it available in case she needed to call for help. It would be easy to think it was still 1900 in this part of Ireland, but that would be a mistake. For one thing, the area had decent cell phone coverage.<br><br>"Looks as if you two have bonded."<br><br>"I think we have, indeed." She slipped the iPhone into a jacket pocket. "You're the detective who saved that girl's life when the bomb went off at your house in Boston last month&#x2014;Wisdom, right? Detective Cyrus Wisdom?"<br><br>He was instantly on alert, but he kept his voice even. "Most people call me Scoop. And you would be?"<br><br>"Sophie&#x2014;Sophie Malone. We have friends in common," she said, easing past him to the ruin. The dog stayed by the stream. "I'm from Boston originally. I'm an archaeologist."<br><br>"What kind of archaeologist?"<br><br>She smiled. "The barely employed kind. You're in Ireland to recuperate? I heard you were hurt pretty badly."<br><br>"I ended up here after attending a friend's wedding in Scotland a few weeks ago."<br><br>"Abigail Browning's wedding. She's the detective who was kidnapped when the bomb went off."<br><br>"I know who she is."<br><br>Sophie Malone seemed unfazed by his response. Abigail was still on her extended honeymoon with Owen Garrison, an international search-and-rescue expert with roots in Boston, Texas and Maine. Will Davenport had offered them his house in the Scottish Highlands for their long-awaited wedding, and they'd accepted, quickly gathering family and friends together in early September. Scoop, just out of the hospital, had had no intention of missing the ceremony.<br><br>"Wasn't it too soon for you to fly given your injuries?" Sophie asked.<br><br>"I got through it."<br><br>She studied him, her expression suggesting a focused, intelligent mind. He had on a sweatshirt and jeans, but she'd be able to see one of his uglier scars, a purple gash that started under his right ear and snaked around the back of his head. Finally she said, "It must be hard not to be in Boston with the various ongoing investigations.<br><br>You have all the bad guys, though, right? They're either dead or under arrest&#x2014;"<br><br>"I thought you said you were an archaeologist. How do you know all this?"<br><br>"I keep up with the news."<br><br>That, Scoop decided, wasn't the entire truth. He was very good&#x2014;one of the best in the Boston Police Department&#x2014;at detecting lies and deception, and if Sophie Malone wasn't exactly lying, she wasn't exactly telling the truth, either.<br><br>She placed her hand on the rough, gray stone of the ruin. "You know Keira Sullivan, don't you?"<br><br>Keira was the folklorist and artist who had discovered the ruin three months ago, on the night of the summer solstice. She was also Lieutenant Bob O'Reilly's niece. "I do, yes," Scoop said. "Is Keira one of the friends we have in common?"<br><br>"We've never met, actually." Sophie stepped up onto the crumbling threshold of the ruin. "This place has been abandoned for a long time."<br><br>"According to local villagers, the original occupants either died or emigrated during the Great Famine of the 1840s."<br><br>"That would make sense. This part of Ireland was hit hard by the famine and subsequent mass emigration. That's how my family ended up in the U.S. The Malone side." She glanced back at Scoop, a spark in her blue eyes. "Tell me, Detective Wisdom, do you believe fairies were here that night with Keira?"<br><br>Scoop didn't answer. Standing in front of an Irish ruin with a scary black dog and a smart, pretty redhead, he could believe just about anything. He took in his surroundings&#x2014;the fine mist, the multiple shades of green, the rocks, the rush of the stream. His senses were heightened, as if Irish fairies had put a spell on him.<br><br>He had never been so in danger of falling in love at first sight.<br><br>He gave himself a mental shake. Was he out of his mind? He grinned at Sophie as she stepped down from the ruin. "You're not a fairy princess yourself, are you?"<br><br>She laughed. "That would be Keira. Artist, folklor-ist and fairy princess." Sophie's expression turned more serious. "She wasn't reckless coming out here alone, you know."<br><br>"Any more than you are being reckless now?"<br><br>"Or you," she countered, then nodded to the dog, who had flopped in the wet grass. "Besides, I have my new friend here. He doesn't appear to have any quarrel with you. He joined me when I got to the stream. He must be the same dog who helped Keira the night she was trapped here."<br><br>"You didn't read that in the papers," Scoop said.<br><br>"I live in Ireland," she said vaguely. She seemed more tentative now. "The man who was also here that night... the serial killer. Jay Augustine. He won't ever be in a position to hurt anyone else, will he?"<br><br>Scoop didn't answer at once. Just what was he to make of his visitor? Finally he said, "Augustine's in jail awaiting trial for first-degree murder. He has a good lawyer and he's not talking, but he's not going anywhere. He'll stay behind bars for the rest of his life."<br><br>Sophie's gaze settled on an uprooted tree off to one side of the ruin. "That's where he smeared the sheep's blood, isn't it?"<br><br>Scoop stiffened. "Okay, Sophie Malone. You know a few too many details. Who are you?"<br><br>"Sorry." She pushed her hands through her damp hair. "Being here makes what happened feel real and immediate. I didn't expect this intense a reaction. Keira and I both know Colm Dermott, the anthropologist organizing the conference on Irish folklore in April. It's in two parts, one in Cork and one in Boston."<br><br>"I know Colm. Is he the one who told you about the black dog?"<br><br>She nodded. "I ran into him last week in Cork. I've just completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the university there. I hadn't paid much attention to what-all went on out here and in Boston." She took a breath. "I'm glad Keira wasn't hurt."<br><br>"So am I."<br><br>Sophie looked up sharply, as if his tone had given away some unexpected, hidden feeling&#x2014;which for all he knew it had&#x2014;but she quickly turned back toward the cottage, mist glistening on her rain jacket and deep red hair. "Do you believe Keira really did see the stone angel that night?"<br><br>"Doesn't matter what I believe."<br><br>"You're very concrete, aren't you?" She didn't wait for an answer. "The story she was researching is so charming&#x2014;three Irish brothers in a never-ending struggle with fairies over a stone angel. The brothers believe it'll bring them luck. The fairies believe it's one of their own turned to stone. Every three months, on the night of the solstice or the equinox, the angel appears on the hearth of a remote cottage in the hills above Kenmare Bay."<br><br>"The old woman who told the story to Keira in Boston&#x2014;"<br><br>"Also told it to Jay Augustine, and he killed her," Sophie said, finishing for him. "Colm says when Keira came out here in search of this place she thought she might encounter a bit of fairy mischief. Maybe she even hoped she would. But a killer? It's too horrible to think about."<br><br>Scoop stood back, feeling the isolation of the old ruin. Except for the dog and the sheep up in the pastures above the stream, it was just him and the woman in front of him. How did he even know she was an archaeologist? Why should he believe a word she said?<br><br>"As many tombs and ruins as I've crawled through in my work, I'm not much on small spaces." She seemed to shrug off thoughts of blood and violence as she tugged her hood over her hair. "You can imagine contentious Irish brothers and trooping fairies out here, can't you? Keira's story is very special. I love tales of the wee folk."<br><br>"Believe in fairies, do you?"<br><br>"Some days more than others."<br><br>"So, Sophie Malone," Scoop said, "why are you here?"<br><br>"Fairies, a black dog and an ancient stone angel aren't reason enough?"<br><br>"Maybe, but they're not the whole story."<br><br>"Ah.

"To be human is to belong," he explains. "Belonging is a circle that embraces everything; if we reject it, we damage our nature. The word 'belonging' holds together the two fundamental aspects of life: Being and Longing, the longing of our Being and the being of our Longing." Although this may sound like an elaborate Celtic circle knot, O'Donohue has nevertheless woven a solid and easy-to-grasp book that speaks to the soul's constant yearning. Every passage is a delight for the senses, as O'Donohue shares his lilting poetic language, his Celtic imagery and stories, and his fireside-chat wisdom. This is a broad-reaching yet highly focused book that dares to explore the realm of legitimate angels, the meaning of suffering, and, most poignantly, how life on earth may never quench the soul's thirst for belonging. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Shows that the eternal values of human life flourish only when we find sanctuary in family, community, &amp; divine relationship</p><h2>2013 Taste of Home Annual Recipes</h2><p>Introducing 2013 Taste of Home Annual Recipes...the only place you&#39;ll find a full year&#39;s worth of Taste of Home recipes (plus bonus recipes) all together in one gorgeously photographed cookbook.

What about the simple pleasures of life -- feeling the wind in your fur, digging up the grass beneath your paws, smelling another dog's butt? Isn't that part of the great joy of being a dog?<br><br>Written (with help) by dogs and for dogs, The Dangerous Book For Dogs provides insight on everything from the tastiest styles of shoes to chew to the proper method for terrorizing squirrels. It also contains portraits of noble dogs throughout history, the mysteries of cats and humans, and everything else your dog ever wanted to know but was afraid to ask&#x2013;like how to make toys out of human's household items, or how to escape from a humiliating reindeer costume.<br><br>Generously illustrated with drawings by cartoonist Emily Flake, this hilarious parody is for good dogs, bad dogs, and the millions of people who love them.<br><br>Rex and Sparky wrote this parody without authorization (because they are dogs and they do what they want.)</p><p>This gentle parody of the bestselling Dangerous Book for Boys-identical in look and tone to its source material-offers an often funny, surprisingly insightful take on dog behavior that's sure to resonate with the Spot set. With the "assistance" of their human companions, canine authors Rex and Sparky relate practical and authoritative information on topics simple (baths, fleas, bones, poop, "things you can chase") and complex: the rules of fetch (it's not officially over until a player earns 17,572 points), tips on crotch sniffing (under the heading "How to Make Your Owner Look Like an Idiot") and a critical guide to frequently ingested items (vomit and poop receive top marks; rocks and keys rank considerably lower). Among more than 50 short entries, the authors seem to have thought of everything, including escape tips for humiliating costumes, stirring true stories ("Great Dog Battles-Part Two: Pepper vs. A Patch of Light") and even a report on Pavlov (written by his two dogs). Though it occasionally pushes the envelope of good taste ("mounting a bitch is never as simple as it seems"), this goofy, gleeful guide to the dog life will tickle anyone with a soft spot for canines. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lincoln</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating and intimate novel of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln, narrated by the First Lady herself </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mary Todd Lincoln is one of history&#x2019;s most misunderstood and enigmatic women. She was a political strategist, a supporter of emancipation, and a mother who survived the loss of three children and the assassination of her beloved husband. She also ran her family into debt, held seances in the White House, and was committed to an insane asylum&#x2014;which is where Janis Cooke Newman&#x2019;s debut novel begins. From her room in Bellevue Place, Mary chronicles her tempestuous childhood in a slaveholding Southern family and takes readers through the years after her husband&#x2019;s death, revealing the ebbs and flows of her passion and depression, her poverty and ridicule, and her ultimate redemption.</p></p><p><i>Mary</i> is a novel written in the first person, comprised of notes composed by Mary Todd Lincoln when she was an inmate of a lunatic asylum. She takes up her pen to block out the screams and moans of the other inmates and to save her own sanity. According to these notes, although she held s�ances in the White House and drove her family deeply into debt because of compulsive shopping, she was perfectly sane. She makes a good case for herself, despite occasional manic behavior and often uncontrollable grief. <p> Mary was born to southern slaveholders in Kentucky, moved to Illinois when she was 20 to live with her sister and met Abe at a cotillion. His opening line was "Miss Todd, I want to dance with you the worst way." Their relationship was odd, to say the least. Lincoln, as portrayed by Janis Cooke Newman, was sexually repressed and feared Mary's passion. She was in an almost constant state of trying to seduce him, usually without success. Despite his gawky, angular, unlovely looks, she adored him--even when she had an affair with another to defuse some of her heat. How much of the bedroom scene is fact and how much fancy must be left to the reader to decide, but it does give credence to Mary's very forward manner and her later "passionate" approach to shopping. </p><p> She used her shopping expeditions to accumulate things that would "protect" her family--and finally herself, when she felt her son Robert's growing disapproval of her. In his statement to the "insanity" lawyer, Robert said, "I have no doubt my mother is insane. She has long been a source of great anxiety to me. She has no home and no reason to make these purchases." Mary saw them as talismans against disaster, and she certainly had suffered disasters in abundance. She buried three sons and was holding her husband's hand when he was assassinated by a bullet to the head. Her eldest son, Robert, was a cold, unfeeling, haughty shell of a man to whom Mary did not speak after she was released from the asylum to her sister's care. She spent four years in Europe and, when her health failed, returned to her sister's house, where she received her son once before she died. </p><p> "First Lady" is a term that was coined to describe Mary Todd Lincoln, while she was the President's wife. It was meant as a backhanded compliment, because she was front and center during much of Lincoln's term. Presidential wives usually stuck to their knitting, but not Mary. Her unconventional ways did her husband a great deal of good; indeed, it was her ambition for him that finally ignited his own ambition. She also helped him to become a great orator. Ultimately, her "unsexed" manner contributed to her being judged insane in 1865 and committed to Bellevue Place, an asylum in Batavia, Illinois, outside Chicago. No President has been more praised nor any first lady more vilified than Abraham and Mary Lincoln. Janis Cooke Newman brings a time, a place and a person to life in a wholly believable and compelling manner. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><p><i>USA</i><i> Today</i>&#x2019;s Best Historical Fiction of the Year</p><p>A <i>Los Angeles</i><i> Times </i>Book Prize Finalist</p><p>Mary Todd Lincoln is one of history&#x2019;s most misunder�stood and enigmatic women.

Squirrel, and their bumbling adversaries, Boris and Natasha, come to life in a detailed account of each episode of the classic animated series, behind-the-scenes anecdotes about its creation, original artwork, and a host of memorabilia.</p><p>In the late &#39;50s and early &#39;60s, the most subversive show ever to hit the airwaves enchanted millions of American grade-schoolers. The kiddies tuned in to watch Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, indulge in cartoon acrobatics and rattle off a series of unbelievable puns. This encyclopedic volume details their every adventure, from chasing the wailing whale Maybe Dick to joining the football team at Wossamotta U. The sinister Pottsylvanian spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale sneak into a goodly share of the pages, along with Dudley Do-Right, the square-jawed Mountie; Snidely Whiplash, the luxuriantly mustachioed villain; Mr. Peabody, the beagle who knows everything; and his boy Sherman. It&#39;s a loving, cleverly-illustrated tribute to these saviors of the free world and an admiring paean to the twisted, hilarious genius of Jay Ward, their modest creator, who set the standard for TV animation for generations to come.The wry, slightly subversive attitude of the TV cartoons featuring Rocky the flying squirrel and Bullwinkle the moose made so great an impression on the baby boom generation that demand for this lavish tribute will doubtless be high. Granted, the pair's show is one of the few TV cartoon series that warrant coffee-table-book treatment. It lacked the visual lushness of classic theatrical animation, but producer Jay Ward compensated for that cost-dictated limitation with witty satirical scripts and brilliant voice work. Unfortunately, while Chunovic supplies plenty of behind-the-scenes tidbits and other information on the series (including a guide to all 326 episodes), he ignores Ward's career before and after the moose-and-squirrel and says virtually nothing about the show's other characters (perhaps Mr. Peabody, Dudley Do-Right, et al., are being held in reserve for future books of their own). Moreover, he tries too hard to capture the cartoons' wackiness with laboriously jocular prose. As Rocket J. Squirrel himself put it, "That trick never works!" <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Word on Fire: Proclaiming the Power of Christ</h2><p><i>Word on Fire</i> is one of the leading introductions to Catholic faith and culture.

Reissue.</p><p><p>The late&nbsp;<strong>Georgette Heyer</strong>&nbsp;was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921.</p> <p>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.</p><p><strong>Excerpt from Chapter One</strong></p> <p>Miss Allison thought that Silas Kane's sixtieth birthday party was going off rather better than anyone had imagined it would. Such family gatherings &#x2014; for the Mansells, through long business partnership with Silas, might almost be ranked as relatives &#x2014; were, in Miss Allison's sage opinion, functions to be attended in a spirit of considerable trepidation. Nor had this one promised well at its inception. To begin with, Silas was at polite variance with old Joseph Mansell. Their disagreement was purely on a matter of business, but although Joseph Mansell, a husband and a father, had existence outside the offices of Kane and Mansell, Silas and his business were one and indivisible. He was not, at the best of times, a man who contributed largely to the gaiety of an evening party. He was invariably civil, in an old-world style that seemed to suit his neat little imperial and the large stock-ties he wore, and he would listen as patiently to a discussion on Surr�alism as to the description of the bird life on the Farne Islands which was being imparted to him at the moment by Agatha Mansell. Both subjects bored him, but he inclined his head with an assumption of interest, smiled kindly and coldly, and said Indeed! or Is that so? at the proper moments.</p> <p>Miss Allison, glancing from his thin, pale face, with its austere mouth and its calm, aloof eyes, to Mrs Mansell's countenance, wondered whether a realisation of her host's complete indifference to her conversation would shake Agatha Mansell's magnificent assurance. Probably it would not. Mrs Mansell had been to college in the days when such a distinction earned for a woman the title of Blue-Stocking and the right to think herself superior to her less fortunate sisters. She had preserved through thirty years this pleasant feeling of superiority and an alarmingly cultured voice which could make itself heard without the least vulgar effort above any number of less commanding accents.</p> <p>'We were disappointed at seeing no gunnets,' announced Mrs Mansell. 'Of course, when we were on Ionah last year we saw hundreds of gunnets.'</p> <p>'Ah, is that so indeed?' said Silas Kane.<br> 'I saw a film about a lot of gannets once,' suddenly remarked young Mr Harte. He added disparagingly: 'It wasn't too bad.'</p> <p>Neither Silas nor Mrs Mansell paid any heed to this contribution to the conversation, and young Mr Harte, who was rising fifteen, returned unabashed to the rending of a drum-stick.</p> <p>Young Mr Harte was not really a member of the family, but his mother, by reason of her first marriage with Silas's nephew James, ranked in the Kanes' estimation as a Kane. James had been killed in the Great War, and although the Kanes bore no ill-will towards Sir Adrian Harte, they could never understand why Norma, who was left in comfortable circumstances, had taken it into her head to marry him. </p> <p>Neither Norma nor Sir Adrian was present at this gathering. Norma, who had developed in her thirties a passion for penetrating into the more inaccessible parts of the world, was believed to be amongst pygmies and gorillas in the Belgian Congo, and Sir Adrian, though invited to the party, had excused himself with a vague and graceful plea of a previous engagement. He had sent in his stead, however, his son Timothy, in charge of Jim Kane, his stepson, who was even now trying to catch Miss Allison's eye over the bank of flowers in the middle of the table.</p> <p>Timothy had come to stay. Jim had brought him down in his cream-coloured sports car with a charming note from Sir Adrian. Sir Adrian had providentially remembered that Silas, upon the occasion of Timothy's last visit, had said that he must come again whenever he liked and for as long as he liked, and Sir Adrian, confronted by the task of amusing his son during the eight weeks of his summer holidays, decided that the day of Timothy's liking to visit Cliff House again had dawned. Miss Allison, sedately avoiding Jim Kane's eye, wondered what young Mr Harte would find to do in a household containing herself in attendance upon an old lady of over eighty years, and Silas Kane. He enlightened her. 'Are there any decent films on in Portlaw this month, Miss Allison?' he inquired. 'I don't mean muck about love and that sort of thing, but really good films, with G men and gangsters and things.'</p> <p>Miss Allison confessed ignorance, but said that she would obtain a list of the entertainments offered.</p> <p>'Oh, thanks, awf'ly; but I can easily buzz into Portlaw on my bike,' said Mr Harte. 'I sent it by train, and I dare say it'll be at the station now, though actually when you send things by train they don't arrive until years after you do.'

During the Cold War, he was a dauntless investigator as well as a towering literary talent, and books such as <i>The Emperor</i> and <i>Travels with Herodotus</i> founded the new genre of &#x2018;literary reportage&#x2019;. It was an achievement that brought him global renown, not to mention the uninvited attentions of the CIA.<br><br>In this definitive biography, Artur Domoslawski shines a new light on the personal relationships of this intensely charismatic, deeply private man, examining the intractable issue at the heart of Kapuscinski&#x2019;s life and work: the relationship and tension between journalism and literature.<br><br>In researching this book, Domos?awski, himself an award-winning foreign correspondent, enjoyed unprecedented access to Kapuscinski&#x2019;s private papers. The result traces his mentor&#x2019;s footsteps through Africa and Latin America, delves into files and archives that Kapuscinski himself examined, and records conversations with the people that he talked to in the course of his own investigations. Ryszard Kapuscinski is a meticulous, riveting portrait of a complex man of intense curiosity living at the heart of dangerous times.</p><p><b>Artur Domos?awski</b> writes on international politics for the weekly review <i>Polityka</i> and for the Polish edition of<i> Le Monde diplomatique</i>, and for two decades reported for the Polish daily <i>Gazeta Wyborcza</i>.

Bass provides searing insights into the complexity of family and romantic entanglements, and his lush and striking language draws us ineluctably into the lives of these engaging people and their vivid surroundings.

At last.</b> For what comes into focus in this collection is that Bass hasn't been writing just to save our wild places, but to save what's wild and humane and best within us. <b>Bass is, hands down, a master of the short form, creating in a few pages a natural world of mythic proportions . . . Bass's world-building is so beautiful, crisp, and perfect . . .</b> He renders every detail with bracing exactness . . .

These heartbreaking, strangely elegiac yet hopeful stories give us the range of what a story can be. Some bloom into tales with nearly all the depth of a novel . . . Others serve as elegant grace notes to entire lives . . . Still other stories work like high lonesome ballads, wrangling loss, love, and hope into haunting harmonies that chill to the bone. The opening story, 'Wild Horses,' is as deeply moving a story as I've read. It traces the slow path toward the ability to love, despite scars that won't ever disappear . . . The influences one can feel in these pages include not only the realist troika of Carver and Ford and Tobias Wolff, but also William Faulkner and Barry Hannah, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, and Eudora Welty too; there's even Tolstoy of the late fables in which people off another grid entirely bear witness to the fact of their own cruel and graceful existence. <b>But everywhere in this beautiful summary collection is a singular voice, that of Rick Bass and Rick Bass only, a writer whose early promise continues to be an enduring gift to readers</b>.

Bass's prose is charged with a lyrical intensity rare in American fiction. <b>The beauty of his sentences recalls the stylistic finesse of McCarthy and Willa Cather,</b> but he does more than just write prettily. Reading Rick Bass offers the deep pleasure of reinhabiting an older world, one that's not lost so much as latent and usually unnoticed . . . Bass, like McCarthy or Faulkner, reaches the universal by revealing the hidden infinities of the particular, both in humans and the landscapes they occupy . . . His metaphors proliferate with an inexhaustible fecundity . . . Bass's short fiction features many ecstatic, dangerous moments-a brush with a mountain lion at dusk, the surging adrenaline of a firefighter in a collapsing house, a girl's pride and confusion after killing her first elk.

A youth of twenty-four, born to comfort and privilege, and now at a crossroads, he sets sail in 1950, with a young man's passionate expectations. Having sold his first book of poems, having recently met ("or so I thought") the love of his life, yet beginning to feel constrained by his social circles, and seeing no way into the next phase of his life, he envisions himself returning from his travels "a different person." His vivid stories of encounters across Europe - with friends and lovers, with great cities, with great works of art, with opera, with psychoanalysis, with artists and aristocrats - are followed by postscripts reaching back to childhood and forward towards the present and the person he is. His memoir enthralls as a revelation of a poet's life, as a portrayal of the complexities that bind a son to his parents, and as perhaps the most lucid and inward account we have had of a homosexual life in a world of intellect and art. A fascinating work. A literary event.</p><p>Eminent poet James Merrill opens his life to us in a memoir that puts wit, sensibility, and elegance of mind to the service of unflinching autobiographical truth.$25. LIT As much a storyteller as a poet, Merrill, the Pulitzer Prize-winning heir to the Merrill-Lynch fortune, delights with this graceful account of a 30-month stay in Europe in the 1950s that was to become the pivotal time of exploration and self-discovery. In his mid-twenties, after having his first book of poems published, Merrill and the "love of his life" depart for Greece and Italy. When the passion disappears, Merrill stays on, attending concerts, meeting and entertaining friends, undergoing psychoanalysis, and, most importantly, writing poetry. His narrative style is so flowing that the account reads more like a novel than a memoir. With refreshing honesty and perception, Merrill introduces us to a young man full of self-doubt, incredible ego, and a large capacity for human kindness. Most libraries with poetry collections will want this. Because of its wonderful sense of immediacy and story, it is also recommended for libraries serving avid biography readers.

I wrote the whole thing in a week, the week before Christmas, in fact, which is so typically congested with last-minute errands, unpredicatable weather, aches and sniffles. For Orthodox Christians, it's also a week that we fast from meat and dairy, adding another ball to the juggling act. Yet somehow I started writing the book on Monday morning and completed it Sunday night, just fourteen minutes after the Christmas Eve service began. (I kept wondering where in the week I'd dawdled and lost that fourteen minutes.)</p><p>It's no wonder that I look at The Illumined Heart as the one out of all of my books that felt the most God-directed. Mostly, he told me when to shut up. For a cup-runneth-over writer like me, starting a book is like moving into mid-pregnancy and putting on those stretch-front trousers for the first time; they're like a license to eat. And knowing that I have room to write on and on, whatever comes to mind, makes for abundant, wandering prose. Yet The Illumined Heart is quiet, proportional, just-enough; it's like a jewel. It's no wonder that this is a personal favorite among my own books, and the one I must urge people to read. I'm pleased by the amount of good work it's done so far, and hope that it will continue to do much more.</p>Frederica Mathewes-Green is a columnist for Beliefnet.com, a contributor to Christianity Today, and a book reviewer for the Los Angeles Times.

But his genius can only truly be appreciated outside Italy through his work as a draughtsman. This book, written to accompany a major exhibition, combines the finest works from three outstanding collections of his drawings in the British Museum, London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Teyler Museum, Haarlem, to tell the story of Michelangelo&#39;s extraordinarily long and active life. An introductory chapter discusses Michelangelo&#39;s contemporary fame, his training and choices of drawing technique, and the role of drawing in the genesis of his works.

In fact, Matisse&#x2019;s stylistic liberation actually goes one step further in the pursuit of his own personal goal &#x2014; the perfect synthesis of line and color &#x2014; by which he sought revolutionary approaches to the great tradition of French painting by drawing upon its classical aspects. For those who wish to know more about this lodestar of modern art and follow the adventurous path of his creative career, this publication is surely the most comprehensive and informative source available. Lavishly illustrated, its authoritative commentaries trace the artist&#x2019;s search for balance, purityand serenity, from the chromatic brilliance of his Fauve period, through his travels, the Orient, geometric synthesis (it was he who introduced Picasso to African art by givinghim his first mask), and the odalisques to the final triumph when, at the age of eighty, he invented his gouache cut-outs that culminated in his illustrations for Jazz and allowed him to achieve his goal of sculpting in paint just as a sculptor works in stone. Matisse is widely acknowledged as an artist whose canvases are extremely difficult to reproduce in print. With this in mind, each work presented here has been painstakingly compared with the respective original, in close collaboration with the artist&#x2019;s grandson, Claude Duthuit. The bard of color deserves no less.</p></p><p>Gilles N�ret (1933&#x2013;2005) was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent.

With spiritual candor, psychological immediacy, and exhilarating emotional intensity, she carries us into the world of Bosch's painting, uncovering the connections between his vision, the world it mirrors, and contemporary life.<br><br>Approaching Paradise, Williams re-enters the terrain of childhood, where the foundations of orthodoxy are built; Hell, in all its diabolical madness, allows her to reflect on the inherent dislocations of our lives; in The Garden, moving away from the dualities of Heaven and Hell, she sees personal engagement as its own form of prayer and celebrates the possibility of a living faith right here on earth. And in Restoration, we meet two sisters, art conservators, who reveal their understanding of artistic vision.<br><br><b>Leap</b> is an unexpected pilgrimage through the landscape of a painting that continues to startle five hundred years after its creation. It is also an utterly original account of one woman's search for the place where faith, passion, and creativity converge. Finally, <b>Leap</b> captures the alchemical moment of imagination -- the flight from the real to the poetic.</p><p>The wonders of biology meet the mysteries of Mormonism in Terry Tempest Williams's spiritual evocation of Hieronymus Bosch's <i>El Jardin de las Delicias</i>. Williams is mesmerized by the painting, and there is much to be fascinated by, including her own stream-of-consciousness exploration of its images and symbolism.<p> <i>The Garden of Earthly Delights</i>, as it's known in English, is part of a triptych, surrounded by wings of paradise and hell. Williams visits the painting daily in the Prado Museum in Madrid, reveling in the gestalt and concentrating on the nuances in the elaborate and extraordinarily detailed masterpiece. One day she'll devote hours inspecting the cavorting, joyous figures, "the blue pool of bathers standing thigh-high in the middle of the triptych," the cherries "flying in the air, dangling from the poles, dropped into the mouths of lovers." Another day she's there with binoculars, cataloguing the birds Bosch chose to place in the garden of earthly delights (she finds 35 of them, including the gadwall, the wagtail, the great white egret, and Tengmalm's owl--a bird who sings "poo-poo-poo," which she considers a bit of prime Bosch paradise humor). Her insight, however, is not limited to the painting. She looks inward and outward, her probing artistic analysis inspiring childhood memories, worldly observations, and universal questions about love and faith.</p><p> Williams's leap into Bosch's garden is an unusual blend of academic rigor and unfettered artistic license, studying the painter's world with erudite discipline, then soaring into lyric associations that'll charm your poetic soul or curdle your objective sensibilities, depending on the latitude you grant in works that mix art history with personal memoir and spiritual exploration. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>"In this lyrical, wise, and questioning book, Terry Tempest Williams leads us in and out of the double-sided looking glass that is Bosch's <i>Garden of Delights</i> and of the heavens and hells of our own natural world. An innovative hybrid, woven of lived experience, visionary thinking, and critical intelligence, Leap points the way to new spiritual dimensions buried in art,'nature,' and our own lives."<br>-- Lucy Lippard, author of <b>Overlay</b> and <b>The Lure of the Local</b><br><br>"Confession: I sat down, opened the book in the middle of it and of a busy day.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up--at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before--hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><em>In Veronika Decides to Die,</em> Paulo Coelho takes reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <em>Veronkia Decides to Die</em> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p></p><p>When Paulo Coelho (<i>The Alchemist</i>) was a young man, his parents had him committed to mental hospitals three times because he wanted to be an artist--an unacceptable profession in Brazil at the time. During his numerous forced incarcerations he vowed to write some day about his experiences and the injustices of involuntary commitment. In this fable-like novel, Coelho makes good on his promise, with the creation of a fictional character named Veronika who decides to kill herself when faced with all that is wrong with the world and how powerless she feels to change anything. Although she survives her initial suicide attempt, she is committed to a mental hospital where she begins to wrestle with the meaning of mental illness and whether forced drugging should be inflicted on patients who don't fit into the narrow definition of "normal." The strength and tragedy of Veronika's fictional story was instrumental in passing new government regulations in Brazil that have made it more difficult to have a person involuntarily committed. Like any great storyteller, Coelho has used the realm of fiction to magically infiltrate and alter the realm of reality. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything&#x2014;youth and beauty, boyfriends and a loving family, a fulfilling job.

Its discussion of the perfect city&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and the perfect mind&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;laid the foundations for Western culture and, for over two thousand years, has been the cornerstone of Western philosophy. As the distinguished Cambridge professor Simon Blackburn points out, it has probably sustained more commentary, and been subject to more radical and impassioned disagreement, than almost any other of the great founding texts of the modern world. In <i>Plato&#x2019;s Republic</i>, Blackburn explains the judicial, moral and political ideas in the Republic with dazzling insight and clarity. Blackburn also examines <i>Republic&#x2019;s</i> remarkable influence and unquestioned staying power, and shows why, from St. Augustine to twentieth century philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Henri Bergson, Western thought is still conditioned by this most important, and contemporary, of books.</p><p>Simon Blackburn is a professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge.In this critical but judicious study, Blackburn (<i>Truth: A Guide</i>) regards what's considered the greatest of Plato's Socratic dialogues as "the foodstuff of unintelligent fundamentalisms." Hitler, totalitarianism and neoconservatism can't be blamed solely on "time and circumstance, land, food, guns, and money, the economic and social forces," he argues, so it may be that Socrates' utopian republic, ruled by philosopher-kings, may also have influenced the world in the worst possible way. Blackburn explores the themes that support such an argument, from Socrates' defense of the right of armies to conquer and colonize, to his extolling the benefits of a caste system. Although Blackburn&#x2014;a philosopher at the University of Cambridge who identifies more closely with Aristotle&#x2014;admits that he "had never felt Plato to be a particularly congenial author," he presents a clear and sympathetic synthesis of approaches to the famous Myth of the Cave, and gives the Platonist defenders their due. He finishes by making the case that the most critical reading of the book may be the best defense against its insidious influences. Hardly a ringing endorsement, Blackburn's book is a provocative companion to an essential text. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Finally, in this riveting new biography filled with exclusive, candid interviews with both Mineo&#x2019;s closest female and male lovers and never-before-published photographs, Michael Gregg Michaud tells the full story of this remarkable young actor&#x2019;s life, charting his meteoric rise to fame and turbulent career and private life.<br><br>One of the hottest stars of the 1950s, Mineo grew up as the son of Sicilian immigrants in a humble Bronx flat. But by age eleven, he appeared on Broadway in Tennessee Williams&#x2019;s <i>The Rose Tattoo,</i> and then as Prince Chulalongkorn in the original Broadway production of <i>The King and I</i> starring Yul Brynner and Gertrude Lawrence. This sultry-eyed, dark-haired male ing�nue of sorts appeared on the cover of every major magazine, thousands of star-struck fans attended his premieres, and millions bought his records, which included several top-ten hits.<br><br>His life offstage was just as exhilarating: full of sports cars, motor boats, famous friends, and some of the most beautiful young actresses in Hollywood. But it was fourteen-year-old Jill Haworth, his costar in <i>Exodus</i>&#x2014;the film that delivered one of the greatest acting roles of his life and earned him another Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe win&#x2014;with whom he fell in love and moved to the West Coast. But by the 1960s, a series of professional missteps and an increasingly tumultuous private life reversed his fortunes.&nbsp;<br><br>By the late sixties and early seventies, grappling with the repercussions of publicly admitting his homosexuality and struggling to reinvent himself from an aging teen idol, Mineo turned toward increasingly self-destructive behavior. Yet his creative impulses never foundered. He began directing and producing controversial off-Broadway plays that explored social and sexual taboos. He also found personal happiness in a relationship with male actor Courtney Burr. Tragically, on the cusp of turning a new page in his life, Mineo&#x2019;s life was cut short in a botched robbery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Revealing a charming, mischievous, creative, and often scandalous side of Mineo few have known before now, <i>Sal Mineo</i> is an intimate, moving biography of a distinctive Hollywood star.</p><p>MICHAEL GREGG MICHAUD&#x2019;s work has appeared in numerous magazines and publications, including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.

Just east of town, in a marshy wasteland in Flushing Meadows, construction proceeded on exhibition halls and pavilions for the 1939 New York World&#x2019;s Fair. In spite of the dark war clouds hovering over Europe, the fair&#x2019;s theme was one of international cooperation. The exciting lure of the World&#x2019;s Fair went unnoticed by most immigrant families trying to survive in an unsteady economy and struggling to pay fourteen cents for a quart of milk and nine cents for a loaf of white bread.<br><br>On Tuesday, January 10, a child was born to a Sicilian immigrant and his American- born Italian wife in an apartment in Harlem. As is the old Sicilian custom, this third son would be named after his father. Salvatore Mineo Jr. was a healthy baby.<br><br>&#x201c;The original pronunciation of our family name was &#x2018;Min-ayo,&#x2019;&#x201d; Sal explained, &#x201c;but we use the Americanized &#x2018;Min-ee-o,&#x2019; with the accent on the first syllable.&#x201d;<br><br>Josephine, a short, well-proportioned woman, was adamant that only English be spoken in her home. Quiet by nature, Mr. Mineo was always self-conscious about his accent, though he was fluent in English. With the exception of a few words and phrases, Sal never learned to speak Italian.<br><br>Two days after Salvatore Jr. was born, a gangster was murdered just outside the Mineo apartment, and his parents decided to move their family immediately. They took a small, three-room, cold-water flat on the fourth floor of a brick building in an Italian section of the Bronx. The monthly rent was $20. The bathtub in the middle of the room doubled as a dining table. &#x201c;The move,&#x201d; said Sal, &#x201c;was a step up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My father was born in Sicily,&#x201d; Sal explained. &#x201c;He came here when he was sixteen, and for two years he could only get odd jobs, doing all kinds of dirty work.&#x201d; Salvatore Mineo Sr. was tall, lanky, and darkly handsome. He fled Sicily in 1929 with nothing more than a sense of adventure and a wooden mandolin strapped to his back. In the daytime<br>he sawed wood for carpenters, laid bricks, and carved little animals in ivory and wood that he sold on the street. In the evening, he courted a young, American-born Italian girl named Josephine Alvisi.<br><br>&#x201c;My mother was born in New York City of Neapolitan parentage,&#x201d; Sal recounted. &#x201c;My dad tried to date her, but she wouldn&#x2019;t go out with him&#x2014;not unless he could speak English. When he finally took her out, she was amazed at how quickly he had learned the language. Here&#x2019;s a guy with ambition, she felt.&#x201d;<br><br>Salvatore married Josephine in 1931 when they were both eighteen years old. He was working as a cabinetmaker and fi nish carpenter when their fi rst child, a son named Victor, was born in 1935. A second son, named Michael, was born two years later.<br><br>When Salvatore Jr. was born in 1939, his father had begun working for the Bronx Casket Company. In the beginning, Salvatore handfinished the coffins. &#x201c;My father was so good,&#x201d; Sal said, &#x201c;they made him a foreman. He worked like a dog&#x2014;even nights. It was my mother though who really made him. Here you are, she told him, working like a dog<br>for others. You should be working for yourself, and for your children.&#x201d;<br><br>The family struggled for several years. The three boys slept in one bed in a small room off the kitchen. Sal wore hand-me-down clothes. Their baby sister, Sarina, born three years after Sal, slept in a nearby crib. &#x201c;We always had plenty of food,&#x201d; Sal recalled, &#x201c;but we did eat lots of spaghetti.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pop and Mama came to realize that they couldn&#x2019;t make a go of it on the money he was earning,&#x201d; Sal explained. &#x201c;And so Pop decided to borrow money and start a business of his own. He knew something about coffin making and chose that as the business he&#x2019;d sink or swim with. My father didn&#x2019;t have a dime, but friends insisted on putting up the money to back him. So, in 1946, he went into business with my uncle, and they opened up Universal Casket Company.&#x201d;<br><br>To begin, the Mineos rented the basement of the building they were living in for the coffin business. A small room was used to show two casket models for prospective clients. Salvatore worked slowly and meticulously, crafting one or two caskets each week.<br><br>Josephine decided her husband needed a secretary. She scraped together a staggering $160 and took a business course by correspondence. At first, she did her husband&#x2019;s accounting at night. But Josephine was ambitious. She told her husband that in addition to doing all the bookkeeping, she would solicit orders on his behalf so he could concentrate on making coffins.<br><br>Her husband worried about their four young children. Josephine had this problem figured out as well. &#x201c;Some days,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;so they don&#x2019;t forget who are their parents, they come to the shop and they stay with us.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Josephine explained, &#x201c;I had to take them to the shop more than I thought I&#x2019;d have to. Because they were only children and they couldn&#x2019;t seem to stay home all day without me and not get into some kind of mischief.&#x201d;<br><br>The boys loved to play jacks and marbles in the gutter and swing like monkeys on the fire escapes, climbing up one and down the other. They played stickball with broom bats in the street, and Sal and Mike regularly got into trouble for dropping piss bombs (urine-filled balloons) on unsuspecting, and sometimes targeted, passersby beneath the roof of their building.<br><br>Kathy Schiano, a childhood friend, recalled Sal fondly. &#x201c;Sal was just so little, and always trying to keep up with his older brothers. He just threw himself in the mix. Victor stuck close to his younger brothers, but Sal and Mike were thick as thieves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The first five years were the toughest,&#x201d; Sal recalled. He never forgot what it was like for his father in those early days. &#x201c;I never saw a man age so fast. He and my uncle used to do all the work themselves&#x2014;hauling lumber, making the caskets, painting them, even delivering them. My mother used to go down every day. And as soon as they were old enough, my two older brothers worked at the company. And as soon as we were old enough to handle tools, Pop taught us how to pitch in and help with the repair work. Soon all of us boys could use a paintbrush, splice a wire, and solder a pipe.&#x201d;<br><br>Sal&#x2019;s main job was staying at home and babysitting his sister. &#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m so close to her,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I took care of her&#x2014;everything from feeding to good-night stories when my parents were working late. Sure, I wanted to be out playing with the other kids, but we all had to help out.&#x201d;<br><br>Every penny Mr. Mineo earned went back into the business, and still they struggled. But Mr. and Mrs. Mineo somehow managed to ensure that none of their children ever wanted for anything. &#x201c;Even if they had to deprive themselves,&#x201d; Sal added. All three sons got the same treatment, too. If one boy wanted a bike, then all three boys got bikes.<br><br>The kids in the neighborhood challenged Sal all the time about his father&#x2019;s business. &#x201c;A guy would come up to me and ask, &#x2018;What does your father do?&#x2019; knowing exactly what he did,&#x201d; Sal said. And Sal would defiantly clench his fists and answer, &#x201c;He makes caskets. What are you going to do about it?&#x201d;</p><h2>Futureland</h2><p>Projecting a near-future United States in which justice is blind in at least one eye and the ranks of the disenchanted have swollen to dangerous levels, Mosely offers nine interconnected stories whose characters appear and reappear in each others&#39; lives. For all its denizens, from technocrats to terrorists, celebs to crooks, &#34;Futureland&#34; is an all-American nightmare just waiting to happen.</p><p><i>Futureland</i> is bestselling mystery author Walter Mosley's first science fiction book since <i>Blue Light</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year. <i>Futureland</i>'s nine linked stories will provide an accessible and intelligent introduction to written science fiction for mystery or mainstream fiction fans who do not normally read the genre.<p> Experienced science fiction readers, however, may be less than satisfied with <i>Futureland</i>. Reading it, you might decide Mr. Mosley grew up reading SF, respects the genre, and still watches SF movies, but has read little SF written during or after the New Wave of the 1960s. However, something more may be going on here than a genre newcomer making beginning-SF-writer mistakes. Mr. Mosley may be deliberately, and craftily, creating SF accessible to his large non-SF readership and to others who are strangers to this genre.</p><p> Some have labeled <i>Futureland</i> cyberpunk, and it does present a dark, infotech-saturated, corporation-controlled future; but it is in fact an inversion of cyberpunk. Instead of that subgenre's cliche of cool, cutting-edge, street-smart, but not very believable outlaws who out-hack and outwit powerful multinational corporations, this Dante-esque collection presents outlaws and outcasts who may be street-wise, but who have little chance of overcoming the corporations and governments that control, and sometimes take, their lives. Like shockingly few other SF works, <i>Futureland</i> directly examines the lives of the working and the nonworking classes, the poor and the marginalized, the criminal and the criminalized. In other words, <i>Futureland</i> is set in a world quite alien to many veteran SF readers, and is therefore a book they should try. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Walter Mosley is the critically aclaimed and bestselling author of the Easy Rawlins series.</p><h2>Daily Roman Missal (Burgundy)</h2><p>One complete large-print volume with generous, easy-on-the-eyes 12-point type!

What is the future of underused physiological functions? Should we expect an evolution of Homo sapiens in relation to the way babies are born? Can fast-developing scientific disciplines induce a new awareness?<br><br>In this wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at the future of birth, renowned obstetrician Michel Odent takes the question 'Do we need midwives?' as a starting point. If a paradigm shift occurs, what kind of midwives shall we need? For how long can we go on neutralizing the laws of natural selection? Are human beings able to raise vital questions before it is too late? Unprecedented situations should first and foremost inspire appropriate questions.</p><p>Michel Odent, MD, has been influencing the history of childbirth and health research for several decades.

In answering this question he achieves nothing less than a masterful analysis of what was going wrong in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century and of what faults of vision had caused these wrongs.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Open Carry: An Action Packed US Marshal Suspense Novel (An Arliss Cutter Novel)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> Bestselling Author of <i>Field of Fire</i> and <i>Tom Clancy Power and Empire </i>and <i>Tom Clancy Oath of Office<br></i><br>&#x201c;Cameron&#x2019;s books are riveting page-turners.&#x201d;</b><br> <b>&#x2014;Mark Greaney, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Law enforcement veteran Marc Cameron brings an explosive authenticity to this powerful new U.S. Marshal series.

Guided by Scripture, Chambers explores every facet of Christian living from the cost of obedience to the rewards of surrender. A gift that will bring lasting joy and peace.</p><p>Oswald Chambers, a Scotsman who converted to Christianity in his teens under the ministry of Charles Spurgeon, has been affecting Christians with his devotional words since <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> was first published in 1935. This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s back in Barbour&#x2019;s special promotional edition!

Ships well-packaged and protected.</p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

This research supports the idea of a miracle enzyme out of which all the enzymes the body needs are produced. He suggests cancer and other diseases occur when this key enzyme is depleted and cannot properly do its job. In this book he clearly shows how what we eat affects that key. Dr. Shinya's science is clearly explained and easy to understand. The suggestions for diet and lifestyle based on this science are simple and easy to follow. Even those who think they know everything about how to eat right will be surprised when they discover what is really healthy. <br><br>This simple health regime has led hundreds of his patients, many suffering from cancer and other life-threatening diseases, to perfect health. <br><br>Inside "The Enzyme Factor" you will discover: <br><br>* How to look younger and delay aging <br>* How to live strengthen your body's natural defenses. <br>* How to become a healthy 100 year old <br>* Misconceptions with many dietary trends <br>* What your intestinal traits can teach you about your health <br>* Why drinking milk will cause osteoporosis <br>* How your body will become oxidized if you eat oxidized foods <br>* Why eating the meat of animals that have a higher body temperature than humans pollutes the blood <br>* The inseparable relationship between the human body and the land <br>* How love activates the immune system <br><br>This is a new, important and affordable approach to health care in America by the world's leading gastroenterologist, and inventor of colonoscopic surgery, who has spent his life in empirical research on the subject of human digestion. If we follow Dr. Shinya's health prescription we will lose weight, be fit, save money and enjoy a long and healthy life.</p><p>A resident of New York City, Dr. Hiromi Shinya leads the gastroenterologist world with new medical findings and techniques. He is a professor of surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Head of the Endoscopic Center of Beth Israel Hospital in New York as well as an adviser for Maeda Hospital and Hanzomon Gastrointestinal Clinic in Japan. He is also Vice Chairman of the Japanese Medical Association in the USA. <p>Long on the forefront of new medical knowledge Dr. Shinya is credited with pioneering colonoscopic surgery without the need for incision. This technique is named the Shinya technique for his contribution.</p>A bestseller in Shinya's native Japan, where it was published in 2005, this title introduces his theory of a "source enzyme" to American readers. Shinya came to New York in 1963 as a medical resident and later pioneered the use of a colonoscope to remove polyps from the colon without abdominal incisions. Now a professor of surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and head of the Endoscopic Center of Beth Israel Hospital in New York, he runs private clinics in New York and Japan. Here, he identifies a precursor enzyme that the body converts to specific types of enzymes as they are needed to support, maintain or repair the body and its functions. Shinya broadly discusses how enzymes work and are exhausted by poor lifestyle habits, medications, environmental pollution, electromagnetic waves and daily stress, and provides simple directives for holistically accessing the power of enzymes, including supplements. Myriad observations from his years of practice include that humans should not eat meat from animals with a higher body temperature than their own; the strength of Americans' digestive systems contributes to illness and obesity; drinking pasteurized milk from cows is lethal to the body; and anticancer drugs do not cure cancer. The real message of Shinya's book is that lifestyle is essential to health. To help readers develop one in tune with nature, he describes his own ascetic daily routine. While some readers may find Shinya's ideas unusual, others may welcome his unorthodox approach. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This makes the picture a separate box and the text below or next to the picture. The bear is a brown bear that starts the day by fishing at the pond. Bear notices a big fish while hooking the worm onto his pole and wants to catch it. The bear stood up to toss his pole in the water but his shadow scared the fish away. The bear tried to tell his shadow to go away but it stayed there. Since the shadow would not leave the Bear decided he would run until the shadow disappeared. The Bear ran around the pond, through a field of flowers and then jumped over a brook ending up hiding behind a tree. Next the Bear went home to get a hammer and nails to nail his shadow to the ground but the shadow did not go down. Then the Bear got out a shovel thinking he could bury the shadow in a deep hole. By the time Bear finished filling the hole up it was afternoon with the sun high in the sky but no shadow to be found. After all this hard work Bear went inside to take a nap awakening after the sun had set. Bear went to open his front door and there was his shadow on the floor so he quickly shut the door going outside and hoping to leave his shadow inside. It turned out his shadow was too quick because it was outside the door with the Bear. Now the Bear decided that if the shadow would let him catch a fish he would let the shadow get one too and when he nodded his head so did his shadow. Back to the pond the Bear goes again but this time the sun is in another part of the sky so the shadow was able to steer clear of scaring the fish. This time the shadow was behind the Bear while in the morning the shadow was in front of him closer to the pond. At the end of the day the Bear and his shadow caught their big fish.</p><p></p><h2>The Person and Work of Christ</h2><p>This classic answers the question, &#34;What does the Bible teach concerning the person of Christ and his work as Redeemer?&#34;</p><p><b>Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield</b> (1887&#x2013;1921) was professor of didactic and polemic theology at the Theological Seminary of Princeton.</p><h2>Sweet Bird of Youth - Acting Edition (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed classic in a new edition, now with an insightful new introduction, the author's original foreword, and the one-act play, <i>The Enemy: Time</i>, on which <i>Sweet Bird of Youth</i> was based.</b><br><br>Sometime actor and full-time male hustler Chance Wayne returns to the Gulf Coast town of St. Cloud in an attempt to retrieve his lost innocence by reuniting with his high school girlfriend, Heavenly Finley. But Chance arrives there with his current employer, the drug-addicted, over-the- hill movie star, Alexandra Del Lago, who uses Chance, teaches him to use others, and doesn't intend to let him go. Chance learns that when he left St. Cloud years before, he left Heavenly with a crippling venereal disease. Heavenly's brother and her father&#x2014;the powerful Boss Finley, a politician who has been responsible for local lynchings&#x2014;have marked Chance as "a criminal degenerate" and plan to castrate him. Williams knew how to tell a good tale, and this gritty and wrenching play also reveals the dark side of the American dreams of youth and fame by implicating small town injustice, systemic racism, and the depth of suffering that results from personal and public corruption.</p><p>The very title of Sweet Bird of Youth is one of ironic pity. The two chief characters--a raddled has-been actress from Hollywood, seeking to forget her present in drugs and sex, and her still handsome masseur-gigolo, who has brought her to his hometown in the South, believing that through her money and faded glamor his gaudy illusions may yet come true--are the reverse side of the American dream of youth. Yet as they work out their fate amid violence and horror, there is nevertheless a note of compassion for the damned.Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) is the acclaimed author of many books of letters, short stories, poems, essays, and a large collection of plays, including The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Camino Real, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Orpheus Descending, The Night of the Iguana, and The Rose Tattoo.<br><br>Lanford Wilson is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American playwright, author of the Book of Days,&nbsp;The Gingham dog, and more.</p><h2>Puzzle Pieces</h2><p>Presley DeGraff is a young woman on the run.

However, the degree of dismay about government today is perhaps unprecedented in our history. Americans are particularly convinced that Congress has become irresponsible, either unwilling or incapable of addressing the nation's problems - while it spends its time and our money on extending its members' careers. Many Americans have come to believe fundamental reform is needed, specifically limits on the number of terms legislators can serve.<br>In Restoration, George Will makes a compelling case, drawn from our history and his close observance of Congress, that term limits are now necessary to revive the traditional values of classical republican government, to achieve the Founders' goal of deliberative democracy, and to restore Congress to competence and its rightful dignity as the First Branch of government. At stake, Will says, is the vitality of America's great promise self-government under representative institutions. At issue is the meaning of representation. The morality of representative government, Will argues, does not merely permit, it requires representatives to exercise independent judgment rather than merely execute instructions given by constituents. However, careerism, which is a consequence of the professionalization of politics, has made legislators servile and has made the national legislature incapable of rational, responsible behavior. Term limits would restore the constitutional space intended by the Founders, the healthy distance between the electors and the elected that is necessary for genuine deliberation about the public interest.<br>Blending the political philosophy of the Founders with alarming facts about the behavior of legislative careerists, Restoration demonstrates how term limits, by altering the motives of legislators, can narrow the gap between the theory and the practice of American democracy.</p><p></p><h2>Peace Between the Sheets: Healing with Sexual Relationships</h2><p><i>Peace Between the Sheets offers </i>a simple but revolutionary analysis: modern relationships often founder because of dysfunctional sexual habits. But when couples shift away from "heat-centered" toward "heart-centered" sexual interactions, they gain a mutual satisfaction that transcends physical gratification. Robinson advocates teaching the body a different response to sexual arousal that is driven by love over biology. The benefits include reducing stress, rejuvenating the body, helping overcome addictions, and developing a positive outlook.

Tolkien</h2><p>The first ever illustrated paperback of the final part of Tolkien&#39;s epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, featuring 15 colour paintings by Alan Lee, Conceptual Designer on Peter Jackson&#39;s THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY. The Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures as the quest continues. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered the Ents. Gandalf returned, miraculously, and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo progressed towards Mordor to destroy the Ring, accompanied by Smeagol--Gollum, still obsessed by his &#39;preciouss&#39;. After a battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for dead; but Frodo is still alive -- in the hands of the orcs. And all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing. JRR Tolkien&#39;s great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.</p><p>THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIG OF OUR TIME<p>While the evil might of the Dark Lord Sauron swarmed out to conquer all Middle-earth, Frodo and Sam struggled deep into Mordor, seat of Sauron's power.

Professional iconoclast and baby boomer Joe Queenan, however, takes a somewhat more benign position: Yes, the baby boomers are venal, self-obsessed egomaniacs blighted by an insalubrious interest in things like the provenance of their neighbors' balsamic vinegar. But this does not make them the "worst generation" -- it just makes them the most annoying.<br><br>In <i>Balsamic Dreams</i>, Queenan chronicles the evolution of his generation and critiques its current condition in chapters such as:<br> <br>--J'Accuse: a bold indictment of the boomers' greatest transgressions, past and present <br>--Ten Days That Rocked the World: in which Queenan identifies the precise moments things went awry (#1: the release of Carole King's <i>Tapestry</i>)<br>--Careful, the Staff Might Hear You: an examination of the unspoken, nefarious alliance between baby boomers and Generation X<br>--American History: The B-Sides: an alternative version of the Republic as played out with baby boomers in the starring roles<br><br>A measured (if a tad cranky) assessment of a generation whose greatest sin lies in confusing lifestyle for life and pop culture for culture, <i>Balsamic Dreams</i> is fresh, funny, and irresistible.<br><br></p><p>As witty as Michael Lewis, more sarcastic than <i>Bobos in Paradise</i>, bloodthirsty pop culture critic Joe Queenan talks trash about his generation and its "lifestyle �ber alles philosophy" in his career-capstone screed, <i>Balsamic Dreams</i>. And what distinguishes the baby boomers, in Queenan's acerbic opinion? "They don't ever actually want anything. They just want a huge number of choices.... They have to videotape everything. They have bottomless faith in self-help, though it's obviously not working.... They're stupefyingly self-centered, unbelievably rude, obnoxious beyond belief, and they're everywhere." Queenan bemoans "the frantic attempt by roly-poly middle-aged Republicans [also known as "the Man in the Gray Flannel Track Suit"] to evince an aura of coolness because they possess one (1) Smashing Pumpkins record and two (2) suede jackets with virtually imperceptible leopard spots." He demolishes Paul Allen's Experience Music Project with sentences like buzz bombs. James Ellroy says that Queenan is "half-Calvinist, half-nihilist," and this book proves it. Perhaps most important, Queenan reveals that "middle-aged men who wear baseball caps turned backwards do not look like Puff Daddy. They look like De Niro's doomed moron catcher in <i>Bang the Drum Slowly</i>." <i>--Tim Appelo</i><br>Joe Queenan is a contributing editor at <i>GQ </i>and writes the column "Good Fences" for <i>The New York Times</i>.

Finnegan pulled me over, I actually thought he was a pretty decent guy. I mean, there&#x2019;s no question I was going over the limit, maybe thirty-five in a residential zone, so I can&#x2019;t say I was surprised to see the lights flashing in my rearview mirror. I was mostly just frustrated&#x2014;disappointed in myself and worried about what Eddie would say when he found out I&#x2019;d gotten a speeding ticket in the company Prius after just a few weeks on the job. <br>The cop who tapped on my window was older than I expected, a big, white-haired guy with a white mustache, probably not too far from retirement. He looked a little bored, like he&#x2019;d asked a few too many people for their license and registration over the years. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the hurry, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just running a little late.&#x201d; I glanced at the insulated pouches stacked on the passenger seat, in case he&#x2019;d missed the magnetic decal on my door: SUSTAINABLE PIZZA&nbsp;&#x2026; FOR THE PLANET WE LOVE. &#x201c;I got stuck at the railroad crossing. I was trying to make up for lost time.&#x201d; <br>That was the wrong answer. <br>&#x201c;You need to be more careful, son. There&#x2019;s a lotta kids in this neighborhood.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; I could feel my face getting warm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;m supposed to make the deliveries in thirty minutes or less.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Try telling that to a dead kid&#x2019;s parents,&#x201d; he suggested. &#x201c;Let me know how it goes over.&#x201d; <br>He was just messing with me, but for some reason I found it all too easy to picture the scene in my head&#x2014;the child&#x2019;s fresh grave, the weeping mother and the broken father, the pathetic delivery driver explaining that the tips are better when the pizza&#x2019;s still hot. It seemed like a plausible version of my future. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really sorry, Officer. It won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not <i>officer,</i>&#x201d; he corrected me. <i>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Lieutenant.&#x201d; <br>He squinted at me for a few seconds, as if coming to a decision, then brought his hand down hard on the roof of the Prius. The thump made me flinch. <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Get the hell outta here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; I was embarrassed by the relief and gratitude in my voice, as if I&#x2019;d just dodged a murder charge rather than a speeding ticket. &#x201c;I can go?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your lucky day,&#x201d; he told me. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I WAS eighteen that fall and all my friends were in college&#x2014;Evan at Harvard, Lauren at Stanford (we were still scratching our heads about that one), Josh at Bowdoin, Lily at Northwestern, Carlos at Cornell. My best friend, Jake, was having the time of his life at Wesleyan&#x2014;he kept inviting me down to hang with his new roommates, but my heart wasn&#x2019;t in it&#x2014;and my ex-girlfriend, Heather, was chilling at Pomona, raving about sunny California in her status updates. That was my high school posse in a nutshell. We were the AP kids, the National Merit Scholars, the summer interns, the future leaders, the good examples. We enrolled in SAT prep classes even when we didn&#x2019;t need to, shared study tips and mnemonic devices, taunted one another with Shakespearean epithets, and made witty comments about the periodic table. We stayed up late going over our notes one last time, threw parties where we studied together for history finals. On Saturday nights, instead of getting drunk and hooking up, we popped popcorn and watched Pixar movies. It wasn&#x2019;t that we were anti-fun; we&#x2019;d just made a group decision to save ourselves for college. <br>The only problem was, I didn&#x2019;t get into college. <br>I&#x2019;d applied to twelve institutions of higher learning and got rejected outright by ten of them, including my safeties. I got wait-listed by two of my likelies, but neither one came through in the end. I got shut out, just like the kid in <i>Accepted,</i> except it was nothing like that because he was a slacker and didn&#x2019;t deserve to get in. <br>I totally deserved it. I mean, I got a combined 2230 on the SATs (superscored, but still), and had a GPA of 3.8, all Honors and APs, top ten percent of my graduating class in one of the premier public high schools in the state. Student Council rep, stagehand for the musicals, helped start a recycling program in the cafeteria. I ran cross-country all four years, even though I hated every tedious mile. But I did it, just so I could list a varsity sport on my transcript. Every goddam miserable thing I ever did, every shortcut I avoided, every scrap of fun I missed out on, I did it just so I could get into a decent college. <br>And none of it mattered. <br>My guidance counselor insisted that it was just a freak occurrence, a perfect storm of bad luck and rotten demographics. A record year for applications, too many international students, preferences for minorities and athletes, a need for geographic diversity, blah blah blah. But come on, not to get in <i>anywhere</i>? Even when kids from my own high school with lower grades and test scores got into colleges where I was rejected? Where&#x2019;s the fairness in that? <br>There was no logical way to explain it, but that didn&#x2019;t stop people from trying. Maybe I was too well-rounded for my own good, or my recs were underwhelming; maybe my essay was pompous, or maybe it was pedestrian. Maybe I hadn&#x2019;t done enough to set myself apart from the crowd, should have written about my lifelong passion for shoemaking, or my desire to someday design prosthetic limbs for transsexuals who&#x2019;d stepped on landmines. Or maybe I&#x2019;d just aimed a little too high, which was possibly true for Dartmouth and Brown, but those were my reaches, so that&#x2019;s the whole point. But what about Connecticut College or George Washington? Was that really too much to ask? <br>April of senior year was such a nightmare. Everybody else was all excited, hugging one another and squealing with delight, the future unfolding before their eyes&#x2014; <i>Colgate! Hampshire! UVM!</i> And then they&#x2019;d notice me, and everything would get all awkward and quiet, almost like somebody in my family had died. People just kept moaning and shaking their heads, telling me how sorry they were, how unfair it was, a complete injustice that shook their faith in the entire system, and I kept telling them not to worry. <br> <i>I&#x2019;m on the wait list at Duke and Grinnell,</i> I&#x2019;d say. <i>I&#x2019;m sure something will pan out</i>. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>THE SECOND time Lt. Finnegan pulled me over&#x2014;just a week after the first incident&#x2014;he was all business. He took my license and registration, went back to his car, and wrote me a ticket for failure to obey a traffic sign, a moving violation punishable by a hundred-dollar fine. <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A hundred bucks? That&#x2019;s crazy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You have the right to contest this citation in the district court,&#x201d; he informed me in a robotic voice. The lights on the police cruiser were flashing lazily, the whole neighborhood pulsing with red. &#x201c;Should you choose to do so, you must notify the court of your intention within twenty days.&#x201d; <br>I didn&#x2019;t reply, because there was no point in going to court. I&#x2019;d definitely rolled through the stop sign&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t about to deny it&#x2014;but I thought he could cut me a little slack. It was ten-thirty at night, and I was driving on a quiet side street out by the conservation land. I&#x2019;d just made my final delivery&#x2014;a lousy one-dollar tip, thank you very much&#x2014;and there was no one else around, no one except for Lt. Finnegan, hiding on the dark street with his lights turned off. <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Lt. Finnegan shined his humongous flashlight in my face. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; <br>I raised my hand to block the glare. &#x201c;Nothing. I was just talking to myself.&#x201d; <br>He clicked off the light and leaned in. His broad face filled my window frame, just a few inches from my own. He wasn&#x2019;t smiling, but I had the feeling he was enjoying himself. <br>&#x201c;Do we have some kind of problem, Donald?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, sir. There&#x2019;s no problem.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. &#x2019;Cause I don&#x2019;t see any reason why we can&#x2019;t be friends.&#x201d; He straightened up, tugged on his gun belt, and turned in the direction of his car. But then he swiveled right back. <br>&#x201c;Tell me something.&#x201d; His voice was casual now, almost friendly. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that mean? <i>Sustainable Pizza</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a name. They use lots of organic ingredients and recyclable boxes. Some of the produce comes from local farms.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;People like that, huh?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Some of &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it better than regular pizza?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Kind of expensive. But the customers keep coming back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; He nodded, as if that was good enough for him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to give it a try.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I HAD two bosses at Sustainable&#x2014;Entrepreneurial Eddie and Stoner Eddie. Entrepreneurial Eddie was an impressive guy, a twenty-four-year-old Middlebury grad who&#x2019;d returned to his hometown to start an eco-friendly pizza restaurant that he hoped someday to grow into a regional, and possibly even national, chain. He was organized, ambitious, and charismatic, a crunchy-granola preppy with shaggy blond hair and the strapping physique of the rugby player he&#x2019;d been in college. He happened to be Jake&#x2019;s cousin, which was the reason I&#x2019;d gotten the delivery job, despite my complete lack of work experience, and the fact that I&#x2019;d only had my license for a couple of months. <br> <i>I&#x2019;m taking a chance on you, Donald. Don&#x2019;t let me down.</i> <br>Entrepreneurial Eddie was always in charge when I started my shift, but he got replaced by Stoner Eddie at the end of the night, after the restaurant section had closed, and Malina and Jadwiga, the two Polish waitresses, had gone home. At that point, it was just me and Eddie and Ignacio, the Salvadoran pizza maker, who stuck around to fill any late-night delivery orders and help out with the cleanup. <br>Entrepreneurial Eddie could be tense and short-tempered, but Stoner Eddie absorbed the news of my moving violation with a philosophical shrug. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way it goes, bro. The cops in this town are ballbusters. There&#x2019;s no crime, so they have to make shit up to keep themselves from dying of boredom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But a hundred bucks?&#x201d; I whined. &#x201c;I work for tips.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how the government rolls, my friend.&#x201d; The two Eddies were different in many ways, but they were both big Ron Paul supporters. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all just taxes in disguise. Right, Ignacio?&#x201d; <br>Ignacio looked up from the floor he was mopping and said something in Spanish. Eddie nodded and said something back. His accent was atrocious, but his meaning must have been clear enough, because Ignacio grinned and added another rapid-fire burst of commentary, to which Eddie replied, <i>&#x201c;Verdad,</i> bro, <i> verdad.&#x201d;</i> I wished I&#x2019;d taken Spanish in high school instead of four years of Latin, which was utterly useless in the real world. It was my guidance counselor&#x2019;s fault: he&#x2019;d insisted that colleges liked students with &#x201c;a classical background,&#x201d; and who was I to doubt him? At that point in my life, I would&#x2019;ve cut my arm off if <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> had mentioned that selective colleges were looking for amputees. <br>After we settled up, Eddie walked me to the front door. We were almost there when he put his hand on my shoulder. <br>&#x201c;Yo, Donald,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re friends with Adam Willis, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Kind of.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Could you do me a favor?&#x201d; He reached into his pocket, pulled out a serious wad of bills, and counted off five twenties. For a second, I thought he was reimbursing me for the ticket. &#x201c;See if you can hook me up with some of that superior weed of his.&#x201d; <br>I didn&#x2019;t take the money. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you ask him yourself?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He never answers my texts.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably just busy. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll get back to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come on, bro. Help me out here. I got a big date this weekend.&#x201d; His voice got soft and confidential. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, that stuff&#x2019;s some kind of aphrodisiac. I smoked half a joint with Malina last week, and that was all it took.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Malina?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know, bro.&#x201d; He grinned at the miracle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been working on her for weeks, and she wouldn&#x2019;t give me the time of day. Couple hits of that magic bud, and the panties just slid right off.&#x201d; <br>It was hard to imagine Malina&#x2019;s panties sliding off for Eddie, or any guy around here. She was pale and chillingly beautiful, with sad eyes and a husky, disdainful voice. She always seemed vaguely offended in the restaurant, as if waitressing was beneath her dignity, and life a bitter disappointment. <br>&#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Eddie tucked the money into my jacket pocket and patted me on the shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m counting on you, bro.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>THE NEXT afternoon, I joined Adam Willis and his chocolate Lab for their daily hike through the woods behind the abandoned state mental hospital. It was creepy back there&#x2014;lots of rusty appliances and old tires lying around, not to mention a tiny cemetery with maybe twenty unmarked headstones and a sign explaining that the graves belonged to former mental patients who&#x2019;d died in the hospital: THOUGH YOUR NAMES ARE UNKNOWN, WE HOLD YOU CLOSE IN OUR HEARTS. I waited until we&#x2019;d been walking awhile before I told Adam that my boss wanted to buy some of his weed. <br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t sell to strangers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I could introduce you. Eddie&#x2019;s a pretty good guy.&#x201d; <br>Adam stopped and scanned the woods, shielding his eyes from the golden light streaming down through the red and gold treetops. It was mid-October, and the leaves had just begun to drop. <br>&#x201c;Yo, Hapster?&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;Where are you, dude?&#x201d; <br>The question was barely out of his mouth when Happy burst out of the woods and onto the trail, his ears flapping as he galloped toward us, the usual look of crazed anticipation on his face. <br>&#x201c;Dassagoodboy.&#x201d; Adam crouched down, scratching Happy&#x2019;s ears and slipping him one of the little bone-shaped treats he carried in his pocket. &#x201c;Dassaverygoodboy.&#x201d; <br>He gave the dog a booming thump on the ribs, and we started walking again. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; Adam said. &#x201c;Why are you even involved with this? If your boss wants some weed, why doesn&#x2019;t he just ask me himself?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He did. He said he texted you a bunch of times and you never got back to him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Damn right. I&#x2019;m not gonna text some guy I don&#x2019;t know.

We&#x2019;d been close as kids&#x2014;pretty much best friends&#x2014;until his mom died of cancer when we were in seventh grade. He turned angry and distant after that, started listening to this dark metal, Slipknot and stuff like that, and hanging out with a druggy crowd. His dad wasn&#x2019;t around a lot of the time&#x2014;I heard he had a girlfriend in another town&#x2014;and Adam did pretty much whatever he wanted, which was mainly just playing video games and getting high and skipping school. Whenever his name came up, my mother called him <i>poor Adam</i> and referred to him as <i>a lost soul.</i> I&#x2019;m pretty sure he didn&#x2019;t graduate. <br>I ran into him outside of CVS one day in September, after everybody else had left for college, and we got to reminiscing about the old days and the fun we used to have. He had his dog with him, and I had nothing else to do, so I tagged along on their afternoon walk. He texted me the next day, asking if I wanted to do it again. <br> <i>Any time,</i> he said. <i>Happy enjoyed the company.</i> <br>If you&#x2019;d told me six months ago that I&#x2019;d be spending my fall living at home and hanging out with Adam Willis, it would&#x2019;ve sounded like a nightmare to me.

New York: Economic Regulation on Trial</h2><p><i>Lochner v. New York</i> (1905), which pitted a conservative activist judiciary against a reform-minded legislature, remains one of the most important and most frequently cited cases in Supreme Court history. In this concise and readable guide, Paul Kens shows us why the case remains such an important marker in the ideological battles between the free market and the regulatory state.<br><br>The Supreme Court's decision declared unconstitutional a New York State law limiting bakery workers to no more than ten hours per day or sixty hours per week. By evoking its "police power," the state hoped to eliminate the employers' abuse of these workers. But the 5-4 majority opinion, authored by Justice Rufus Peckham and renounced by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, cited the state's violation of due process and the "right of contract between employers and employees," which the majority believed was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.<br><br>Critics jumped on the decision as an example of conservative judicial activism promoting laissez-faire capitalism at the expense of progressive reform. As series editors Peter Hoffer and N.E.H. Hull note in their preface, "the case also raised a host of significant questions regarding the impetus of state legislatures to enter the workplace and regulate hours, wages, and working conditions; of the role of courts as monitors of the constitutionality of state regulation of the economy; and of the place of economic and moral theories in judicial thinking."<br><br>Kens, however, reminds us that these hotly contested ideas and principles emerged from a very real human drama involving workers, owners, legislators, lawyers, and judges. Within the crucible of an industrializing America, their story reflected the fierce competition between two powerful ideologies.</p><p>"Kens has hit the mark. He treats complicated matters in ways that make them accessible to general readers and students and tells a terrific story. Teachers of constitutional and legal history will embrace this book."--Kermit Hall, author of <i>The Magic Mirror: Law in American History</i> <p>"An outstanding volume that deserves a wide audience. Virtually all observers agree that <i>Lochner</i> is one of the most important decisions ever rendered by the Supreme Court. It continues to cast a long shadow over constitutional thought despite the political triumph of the New Deal and the rejection of the liberty of contract doctrine in the late 1930s. Kens's balanced and judicious treatment should contribute greatly to the current dialogue over economic due process and judicial protection of property rights."--James W. Ely, Jr., author of <i>The Guardian of Every Right: A Constitutional History of Property Rights</i></p>Paul Kens is associate professor of political science and history at Southwest Texas State University and the author of <i>Justice Stephen Field: Shaping Liberty from the Gold Rush to the Gilded Age</i> and <i>Judicial Power and Reform Politics: The Anatomy of Lochner v.

Pollack challenges conventional expectations about manhood and masculinity that encourage parents to treat boys as little men, raising them through a toughening process that drives their true emotions underground. Only when we understand what boys are really like, says Pollack, can we help them develop more self-confidence and the emotional savvy they need to deal with issues such as depression, love and sexuality, drugs and alcohol, divorce, and violence.</p><p>&#x201c;Just as <i>Reviving Ophelia</i> opened our eyes to the challenges faced by adolescent girls,<i> Real Boys</i> helps us hear and respond to the needs of growing boys.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Judith Jordan, Ph.D., Harvard Medical School</i></p><p>Featuring a new preface by the author on how parents can make a difference.</p></p><p>Listening to the author William Pollack read <i>Real Boys</i>, it doesn't take long to find out that being a boy these days isn't all fun and games. As codirector of the Center for Men at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical Center, Pollack has seen behind the stoic masks of troubled, modern boys as they struggle to cope with the mixed messages, conflicting expectations, and increasingly complex demands they receive from our evolving society. "New research shows that boys are faring less well ... that many boys have remarkably fragile self-esteem, and that the rates of both depression and suicide in boys are frighteningly on the rise."<p> What are parents to do? They could start by listening to the author's thoughts on contemporary child-rearing techniques, analysis of the root causes of many male behavior problems, and recommendations for avoiding all-too-common pitfalls. In <i>Real Boys</i>, Pollack draws upon nearly two decades of research to support his theories and makes an impressive assault on the popular myths surrounding the conventional definition of masculinity.</p><p> While listening to <i>Real Boys</i>, it is important to remember that Pollack is a psychologist, not a professional narrator. His enunciation is less than perfect and his reading sometimes strikes a clinical tone, but his intelligent writing and the obvious concern he holds for this important subject help carry a passionate message and compensate for any vocal shortcomings.

It's a deeply informative, absolutely invaluable guide to understanding the unique problems and stresses that boys face . . .<br>Pollack reads in an earnest , sincere tone . . .

Juanito longs to be in one place, rather than "going, going, going," and pines for the love of his often-absent father. This family story of growing up Latino will resonate with readers of all backgrounds.</p><p>Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Herrera's novel in verse tells of a year in the life of 10-year-old Juanito Palomares in late-1950s California. At the mercy of his roving father, the young Chicano reports on his sometimes bleak, yet ultimately hopeful existence. When he and his mother bunk with relatives in San Francisco, his cousin Chacho demands, You wanna be a chump/or a champ? to get him to box Sweet Pea Price, and to pursue wild dares at the hospital morgue. His father's return puts him in motion once again. San Diego is his next home, where he continues to change apartments and schools, often just as he begins to look forward to a special event. Flashbacks to the family's time in the state's central farm region, living by picking, show Juanito's guilt at revealing the Garcia family's location to the green van immigration officials. The Palomareses demonstrate a wealth of love when Juanito's father loses both legs to complications from diabetes, curtailing his travels. The language varies from prosaic sentences broken into lines of verse to poems quite lyrical, but action is in short supply. Lacking the universal appeal of Sandra Cisneros's <i>The House on Mango Street</i> (Knopf, 1991) and less engrossing than Karen Hesse's <i>Out of the Dust</i> (Scholastic, 1997), this novel perhaps speaks more to adult readers than to young people, who may not feel as much kinship to this boy of their grandparents' generation or before, even if they share his Latino heritage.<i>&#x2013;Suzanne Gordon, Richards Middle School, Lawrenceville, GA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 5-8. The author of <i>Crash Boom Love</i> (2000) offers another stirring novel-in-verse written in the voice of a young Chicano boy. In 1950s California, 10-year-old Juanito is tired of moving with his migrant-worker parents and staying in relatives' homes in San Francisco's Mission District. He aches for his often-absent father. Finally, Papi returns, and home becomes San Diego, where Juanito settles into a deeper sense of place and faces family secrets and hardship. Herrera's free-verse lines make poetry from the sounds and rhythms in everyday life: one passage, for example, juxtaposes the Boys' Club boxers' relentlessly bouncing feet with Juanito's memories of constant movement. Some younger readers may need to talk about a brief, nonexplicit scene in which Juanito evades an apparent pedophile, but many kids will connect with the vivid portrait of a family, the struggles of undocumented immigrants, and a boy's search for the young man he will become: "Sometimes I see a boy / blurry and worried; / sometimes I see a boy / strong and tall." <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It had been six months since Tiffany, the last one. She had lasted twenty days, longer than most of the others. </p><p>He had tried to put Bree Matthews out of his mind. It didn't make sense to invite her, he knew that. Every morning as he followed his routine, washing the windows, polishing the furniture, vacuuming the carpets, sweeping and washing the walk from the steps to the sidewalk, he reminded himself that it was dangerous to choose a next-door neighbor. Much too dangerous. </p><p>But he couldn't help it. Bree Matthews was never out of his mind for an instant. Ever since the day she had rung his bell and he had invited her in, he had known. That was when his growing need to have her with him became uncontrollable. She had stood in his foyer, dressed in a loose sweater and jeans, her arms folded, one high-arched foot unconsciously tapping the polished floor as she told him that the leak in her adjoining town house was originating from his roof. </p><p>"When I bought this place I never thought I'd have so much trouble," she had snapped. "The contractor could have redone Buckingham Palace for what I paid him to renovate, but whenever it rains hard, you'd think I lived under Niagara Falls. Anyway, he insists that whoever did your work caused the problem." </p><p>Her anger had thrilled him. She was beautiful, in a bold, Celtic way, with midnight blue eyes, fair skin, and blue-black hair. And beneath that she had a slim athlete's body. He guessed her to be in her late twenties, older than the women he usually favored, but still so very appealing. </p><p>He had known that even though it was a warm spring afternoon, there was no excuse for the way perspiration began to pour from him as he stood a few inches from her. He wanted so much to reach out and touch her, to push the door closed, to lock her in. </p><p>He had blushed and stammered as he explained that there was absolutely no possibility that the leak was coming from his roof, that he'd done all the repairs himself. He suggested she call another contractor for an opinion. </p><p>He had almost explained that he had worked for a builder for fifteen years and knew that the guy she had hired was doing a shoddy job, but he managed to stop himself. He didn't want to admit that he had any interest in her or her home, didn't want her to know that he had even noticed, didn't want to give anything about himself away.... </p><p>A few days later she came up the street as he was outside planting impatiens along the driveway, and stopped to apologize. Following his advice, she had called in a different contractor who confirmed what she had suspected: the first one had done a sloppy job. "He'll hear from me in court," she vowed. "I've had a summons issued for him." </p><p>Then, emboldened by her friendliness, he did something foolish. As he stood with her, he was facing their semidetached town houses and once again noticed the lopsided venetian blind on her front window, the one nearest his place. Every time he saw it, it drove him crazy. The vertical blinds on his front windows and those on hers lined up perfectly, which made the sight of that lopsided one bother him as much as hearing a fingernail screech across a blackboard. </p><p>So he offered to fix it for her. She turned and looked at the offending blind as if she had never seen it before, then she replied, "Thanks, but why bother? The decorator has window treatments ready to put in as soon as the damage caused by the leaks is repaired. It'll get fixed then." </p><p>"Then, " of course, could be months from now, but still he was glad she had said no. He had definitely decided to invite her to be his next guest, and when she disappeared there would be questions. The police would ring his bell, make inquiries. "Mr. Mensch, did you see Miss Matthews leave with anyone?" they would ask. "Did you notice anyone visiting her lately? How friendly were you with her?" </p><p>He could answer truthfully: "We only spoke casually on the street if we ran into each other. She has a young man she seems to be dating. I've exchanged a few words with him from time to time. Tall, brown hair, about thirty or so. Believe he said his name is Carter. Kevin Carter." </p><p>The police would probably already know about Carter. When Matthews disappeared they would talk to her close friends first. </p><p>He had never even been questioned about Tiffany. There had been no connection between them, no reason for anyone to ask. Occasionally they ran into each other at museums -- he had found several of his young women in museums. The third or fourth time they met he made it a point to ask Tiffany her impression of a painting she was looking at. </p><p>He had liked her instantly. Beautiful Tiffany, so appealing, so intelligent. She believed that because he claimed to share her enthusiasm for Gustav Klimt, he was a kindred spirit, a man to be trusted. She had been grateful for his offer of a ride back to Georgetown on a rainy day. He had picked her up as she was walking to the Metro. </p><p>She had scarcely felt the prick of the needle that knocked her out. She slumped at his feet in the car, and he drove her back to his place. Matthews was just leaving her house as he pulled into the driveway; he even nodded to her as he clicked the garage door opener. At that time he had no idea that Matthews would be next, of course. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright� 1997 by Pocket Books</p></p><h2>In the Dust of Kilimanjaro</h2><p>The director of the Kenya Wildlife Service recounts his childhood in Tanzania, the dawning of his concern for Africa&#39;s environment and wildlife, and his pioneering of a new approach to global wildlife conservation that balances the needs of people and animals.

He was formerly director of Kenya Wildlife Service and chairman of the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya and IUCN's African Elephant and Rhino Specialist Groups. He is the editor of <i>Natural Connections.</i></p><p></p><p></p>Western, the director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, describes his career in African wildlife conservation, beginning with his childhood in the bush of Tanganyika. His experiences with his hunter father formed the basis for his lifelong commitment to saving African wildlife. At the same time, he was one of the earliest conservationists to insist that preservation efforts must include native peoples, in this case the Maasai of Amboseli National Park, where Western conducted field research. The most engaging segments of this book trace his friendship and collaboration with the Maasai, who needed the parklands for grazing their cattle. He describes the years of political and scientific maneuvering needed to establish policies in the best interest of wildlife, native Africans, and tourists alike. Included are his views on the world ban on ivory, which are a bit surprising. Western writes very well?often lyrically?about wild Africa and displays a charming readiness to admit when he's been wrong.

H. Fairchild] is the American voice at its best: confident and conflicted, celebratory and melancholic.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>New York Times</em></strong></p> Gathering works from five of B. H. Fairchild's previous volumes stretching over thirty years, and adding twenty-six brilliant new poems, <em>The Blue Buick</em> showcases the career of a poet who represents "the American voice at its best: confident and conflicted, celebratory and melancholic" (<em>New York Times</em>). <p>Fairchild's poetry covers a wide range, both geographically and intellectually, though it finds its center in the rural Midwest: in oilfields and dying small towns, in taverns, baseball fields, one-screen movie theaters, and skies "vast, mysterious, and bored." Ultimately, its cultural scope&#x2015;where Mozart stands beside Patsy Cline, with Grunewald, G�del, and Rothko only a subway ride from the Hollywood films of the 1950s&#x2015;transcends region and decade to explore the relationship of memory to the imagination and the mysteries of time and being. And finally there is the character of Roy Eldridge Garcia, a machinist/poet/philosopher who sees in the landscape and silence of the high plains the held breath of the earth, "as if we haven't quite begun to exist. That coming into being still going on."</p><p>From the machine work elevated to high art that is the subject of <em>The Arrival of the Future</em> (1985) to the despairing dreamers of <em>Early Occult Memory Systems of the Lower Midwest</em> (2002) to the panoramic, voice-driven structure of <em>Usher</em> (2009), Fairchild's work, "meaty, maximalist, driven by narrative, stakes out an American mythos" (David Ulin, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>).</p><p>From "The Blue Buick:"<br> A boy standing on a rig deck looks across the plains.<br> A woman walks from a trailer to watch the setting sun.<br> A man stands beside a lathe, lighting a cigar.<br> Imagined or remembered, a girl in Normandy<br> Sings across a sea, that something may remain.</p></p><p>B. H. Fairchild, the author of several acclaimed poetry collections and a recipient of Guggenheim and NEA fellowships, has been a finalist for the National Book Award and winner of the William Carlos Williams Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Bobbitt National Prize. He teaches in the creative writing PhD program at the University of North Texas.&#x201c;One of the most readable poets of our time... [<em>The Blue Buick</em>] confirm[s] that his matter and his manner have been consistent throughout his career, as has the high quality of his achievement... This is poetry of the extraordinary ordinary, nonpareil.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ray Olson, <em>Booklist, starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The poetry of B.H. Fairchild is a cause of celebration... Noisy, visually arresting poems, full of occult weather systems, the barbed nostalgia of a man born into one world, now inhabiting another... [Fairchild] has spent a lifetime singing the body electric of small, dying towns, day-laborers and the beers at the end of their day, the pressure it puts on the man who must remember it all.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Freeman, <em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fairchild also inherits a gorgeous linguistic excess, a sense of language as bravura performance, exemplified not only by his voluble narrators of his conversational dramatic monologues, but also by his frequent use of simile, metaphor, and compound allusions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Hudson Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fairchild achieved the kind of poetic everyday speech that has been an aspiration of modernism ever since the fruitful friendship of Robert Frost and Edward Thomas.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Chronicles</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;English-language poetry has inherited a great book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Stewart, <em>New Letters</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;By imagining, by envisioning in retrospect the beauty of the past, [Fairchild] creates present and future beauties as reflections and extensions of that past, though at the time it was merely the chrysalis of what would become, for him, beautiful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Beloit Poetry Journal</em></strong></p><h2>Blood of the Mantis (Shadows of the Apt, Book 3)</h2><p>Driven by the ghosts of the Darakyon, Achaeos has tracked the stolen Shadow Box to the marsh-town of Jerez, but he has only days before the magical box is lost to him forever. Meanwhile, the forces of the Empire are mustering over winter for their great offensive, gathering their soldiers and perfecting their new weapons. Stenwold and his followers have only a short time to gather what allies they can before the Wasp armies march again, conquering everything in their path. If they cannot throw back the Wasps this spring then the imperial black-and-gold flag will fly over every city in the Lowlands before the year&#39;s end. In Jerez begins a fierce struggle over the Shadow Box, as lake creatures, secret police and renegade magicians compete to take possession. If it falls into the hands of the Wasp Emperor, however, then no amount of fighting will suffice to save the world from his relentless ambition.</p><p>Adrian Tchaikovsky was born in Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire before heading off to Reading to study psychology and zoology.

Visit http://shadowsoftheapt.com/.The third Shadows of the Apt volume extends the series' excitement and complexity. New characters crop up, and the inner workings of the Wasp Empire become a greater part of the story. With a war ongoing, technological advances are creating more deadly weapons, and the original motley band of resisters has been scattered. As each splinter group pursues its goals, the series' characters face ever more difficult choices. When is betrayal a good thing? What goals are worth sacrificing lives for, and when, on the other hand, does doing so become &#x201c;evil&#x201d;? Is the advancement of technology justified for its own sake? For readers who enjoy delving into the psychology of the characters, this installment fills the bill. The series as a whole continues to be a well-woven tapestry portraying the living world of the insect-kinden. Even as some questions are answered, more emerge, and the intensity of the proceedings pulls the reader deeper into them. --Rebecca Gerber</p><h2>Morning Glory: Penhaligon&#39;s Scented Treasury of Spring Verse and Prose</h2><p>A celebration of spring through verse, prose and pictures.

In this book Mark A. Yarhouse and James N. Sells survey the major approaches to family therapy and treat, within a Christian framework, significant psychotherapeutic issues. The wide array of issues covered includes <ul><li>crisis and trauma</li><li>marital conflict</li><li>separation, divorce and blended families</li><li>individual psychopathology</li><li>substance abuse and addictions</li><li>gender, culture, economic class and race</li><li>sexual identity</li></ul> Calling for an integrated approach of "responsible eclecticism," they conclude with a vision for Christian family therapy. A landmark work providing critical Christian engagement with existing models of family therapy, this volume was written for those studying counseling, social work, psychology or family therapy. <em>Family Therapies</em> will also serve as an indispensable resource for those in the mental health professions, including counselors, psychologists, family therapists, social workers and pastors.</p><p>Mark Yarhouse (PsyD, Wheaton College) is the Hughes Endowed Chair and professor of psychology at Regent University where he directs the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity and is a core faculty member in the doctoral program in clinical psychology.

He serves on the editorial board of the <em>Journal of Psychology and Theology</em> and <em>Christian Counseling Today</em>, and has served as an ad hoc reviewer with <em>Journal of Homosexuality</em>."Yarhouse and Sells have created a masterpiece work analyzing approaches to family therapies. This is going to be a new classic, matching the accomplishment of Jones and Butman's analysis of psychotherapies in their book, <em>Modern Psychotherapies.</em>" (Everett L. Worthington Jr., professor of psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University)<br><br>"Mark Yarhouse and James Sells have written a very helpful book that is comprehensive, biblically based and well-written. I highly recommend it as an excellent text for those interested in a Christian approach to family therapy." (Siang-Yang Tan, Ph.D., professor of psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, and senior pastor, First Evangelical Church of Glendale, California)<br><br>"In <em>Family Therapies,</em> Yarhouse and Sells provide an important resource for Christian scholars and therapists. The first two sections provide a thoughtful foundation and Christian critique of existing therapy models, reminiscent of what Stanton L. Jones and Richard E. Butman accomplished in their classic book, <em>Modern Psychotherapies,</em> but with a focus on models of family therapy. The third section, which could have been a book on its own, looks at contemporary issues in relation to a Christian perspective on family therapy. The final section casts a vision for an integrative model of family therapy. This is a significant book that will help shape the training and practice of Christian therapists." (Mark R. McMinn, Ph.D., ABPP, professor of psychology, George Fox University, an`d coauthor of Integrative Psychotherapy)<br><br>"Yarhouse and Sells have written a practical, concise, invaluable, one- of-a-kind resource that integrates biblical, theological, psychological, theoretical, clinical and practical resources in ways that help the reader look at the family and family therapy through different lenses and better understand the individual in the context of their broader family system.

The space station poster from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey , the space mural at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, and numerous U.S. Postal commemorative issues all bear his distinctive stamp, one that enthusiastically celebrates space achievements and projects an optimistic future in which high technology exists in harmony with nature. Despite Ray Bradbury's overwrought introduction, this collection presents McCall at his best, including 30 works not published before. As such, it updates Ben Bova's previous collection of McCall's art, Vision of the Future ( LJ 2/15/83). It will appeal to space buffs and should be a useful addition to collections that already have Bova's book and the classic space art collection Eyewitness to Space (1971. o.p.).<br><i>- Thomas J.

Can this proud warrior pledge his heart to a woman whose secret threatens to change their lives forever?</p></p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman lives there in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband.&nbsp; Three cats and a stray young bull moose keep them company.&nbsp; The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also writes contemporary romances.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> Pine Creek, Maine, October 22 </p><p> A shout woke him as he spiraled through the horrific void, twisting and clawing to find something of substance to hold on to. But there was only blinding white light and the terror of knowing his fate was beyond his control. </p><p> Michael MacBain opened his eyes, held himself perfectly still, and listened to the silence broken only by his own labored breathing. He slowly sat up and scrubbed the sweat from his face, then untangled his legs from the sheet, threw back the cover, and stood. He walked to the window, lowered the top sash, and took slow, metered breaths of the crisp October air, letting it wash over his quivering muscles. </p><p> A full two minutes passed before his heart finally calmed and his head cleared. Michael sighed into the night. All was right with the world, he decided as he stared into the darkness; the moon-washed mountains still cast their shadow over his farm, the stars still shone from the heavens, his house stood peaceful. And his son, Robbie, was safe in his bed, and John was sleeping downstairs. </p><p> Michael scrubbed his face again with tired impatience. The dreams were becoming more detailed. And far more frequent. </p><p> They started with Maura -- with her funeral. In the dream, Michael would see himself crouched on the hillside, hidden from the MacKeages, watching them bury his woman outside the fence that separated the sinners from the decent. </p><p> Ian MacKeage was placing his daughter in unhallowed ground. And as they covered Maura with unholy dirt and the dream progressed, Michael would relive the anger and utter impotency he had felt that day. </p><p> She hadn't killed herself -- she'd wandered onto the rotten ice of the loc by mistake because of the snowstorm. She'd been coming to him, running away from her clan to get married, so their child would be born with the blessing of the church. </p><p> And from there, the dream would change to his confrontation with Ian MacKeage that fateful day eight hundred years ago. Michael's feelings of heartbreak had been compounded by Ian's harsh reprisals. Michael had walked away, unable to reason with Maura's father. </p><p> Aye, it was then he had decided to go to war. </p><p> The dream would shift rapidly, this time to a <i>gleann</i> not far from the MacKeage keep. Greylen, Ian, Morgan, and Callum MacKeage were on their way home from talks with the MacDonalds, looking smug in their success at gaining the other clan's aid against the MacBains. </p><p> And so Michael and his five warriors had attacked -- and his dream turned into a nightmare hellish enough to curdle a warrior's blood. </p><p> The storm descended upon them without warning. The sounds of battle turned into a frenzy of shouting men, screaming horses, and deafening thunder. A godless wind came first, roaring down from the heavens, uprooting trees, and churning up dust that clogged their throats. Lightning sizzled through the air, and the rain started, ruthlessly pounding against them. And the last thing Michael remembered seeing was a small, aged man standing on the bluff above them, watching in horror. </p><p> Sometimes -- if he were lucky -- he'd wake up then. His own scream of terror was enough to jolt him from the nightmare, and he'd find himself in his bed, in the twenty-first century, safe but no closer to understanding how ten men and their warhorses could be hurtled forward eight hundred years through time. </p><p> Nor, even after living in this modern world for twelve years now, was he any closer to understanding why. </p><p> But sometimes he didn't wake up, and the nightmare continued, settling back into a less violent but just as disturbing dream, with him standing on the summit of TarStone Mountain, at sunrise on Summer Solstice eight years ago. </p><p> In the dream, Michael was casting the ashes of Mary Sutter, Robbie's mother, onto the gentle breeze, watching it carry her away. He was holding their infant son in his arms, surrounded by the MacKeage warriors who shared his fate, Mary's sister, Grace, and Mary's six half brothers. The priest, Daar, was there as well -- the same man he had seen on the bluff in the storm eight hundred years ago. </p><p> Michael rubbed his now dry chest and looked toward TarStone Mountain. Daar was actually a <i>dr�idh</i> named Penda�r. He lived halfway up TarStone now, hiding behind his priest's robes and neighborly smile. </p><p> The four MacKeage warriors were also his neighbors, their ancient war superseded by their need to survive in this modern time. The blood tie of the eight-year-old boy sleeping down the hall now bound them together. Greylen's wife, Grace Sutter MacKeage, was Robbie's aunt. And to the man, the old <i>dr�idh</i> included, Robbie's happiness came first. </p><p> Michael continued staring out the window, but his focus suddenly shifted to the soft footsteps coming into his room, and he waited until Robbie was about to pounce before he spoke. </p><p> "Ya best be heavily armed, son," he said softly, still not turning around. "And prepared for the consequences." </p><p> The footsteps stopped. </p><p> Michael looked over his shoulder and smiled at the boy standing three paces away, his hands on his naked hips and a scowl on his young face. </p><p> "A noble warrior does not use a weapon on an unarmed man," Robbie countered, obviously insulted. His scowl suddenly changed to a diabolical smile as he raised his hands and wiggled his fingers. "It was a tickle attack I was planning." </p><p> Michael closed the window, picked up his pants, and put them on. He faced his son as he slipped into his shirt. "How about you get dressed instead," he suggested, "and we head for the summit now?" </p><p> "Now?" Robbie echoed, lowering his hands back to his hips and looking at the clock by Michael's bed. "But it's only two in the morning." </p><p> Michael reached into the top drawer of his bureau for socks. "We might make it by sunrise," he offered. </p><p> Never one to need an excuse for an adventure, Robbie clapped his hands. "Can we bring the swords?" he asked. </p><p> "Aye," Michael agreed as he sat on the bed to put on his socks. "Dress warm, and bring our packs when you come downstairs. I'll put together some food to take with us and leave John a note." </p><p> Robbie was out the door and running down the hall before Michael could finish giving his orders. Michael stood up and tossed the sheet back over the mattress, which was still damp with his sweat. </p><p> His shout must have awakened Robbie. And being far too astute for his age, the boy had known his father was dreaming again and had tried to distract him with a tickle attack. </p><p> Michael stared at the rumpled bed. This was the third time he'd had the dream in the last six weeks. Before that, he'd relived the horror only occasionally. </p><p> It wasn't the dream itself that disturbed him but more its escalating frequency. Michael walked back to the window, rested his arms on the top sash, and stared at TarStone. Were the dreams a precursor to something? </p><p> The nightmare retold his past, not his future. </p><p> Was another vision about to be added to the sequence? </p><p> More importantly, did he hold the power to control the outcome this time? He'd made a new life for himself here and now had a son to guide into manhood. Nothing must come between him and Robbie, not an aging wizard and most especially not the magic. </p><p> "Come on, Papa. I'm dressed, and you haven't even packed anything yet," Robbie said from the doorway. "I want to be on the summit by sunrise." </p><p> Michael gathered up his sweater from the back of a chair and walked into the hall, gently prodding his son ahead of him. "Do we ride or walk?" he asked. </p><p> "Walk," Robbie quickly answered, skipping down the stairs, the empty packs slapping against the banister. "Stomper is too old to wake up this early, and Feather's too lazy." Robbie stopped at the bottom, looked up at Michael, and said in a lowered voice so he wouldn't wake up John, "I'm not up to fighting that stubborn pony this morning. Besides, he doesn't like my sword. I think it pokes him when I'm riding." </p><p> "How about the four-wheeler?" Michael asked, his voice also hushed. </p><p> Robbie shook his head. "Too noisy. We won't see any of the night animals." </p><p> Michael gave his son a nudge toward the kitchen. "You write the note for John and fill our packs. I'll get our swords." </p><p> "Can I use Robert's sword?" Robbie asked. </p><p> Michael lifted a brow. "You're too tired to fight with Feather but willing to hike to the summit of TarStone carrying Robert's sword?" </p><p> The boy thought hard on that prospect, then slowly shook his head. "Nope. It's too heavy." He suddenly brightened. "You could carry both." </p><p> After another nudge to get him moving toward the kitchen, Michael turned and headed to the library. "Nay, son. A warrior carries his own weapon," he said over his shoulder. </p><p> Michael continued into the library, came to a stop in front of the hearth, and studied the three swords hanging over the mantel. Two of them were as long as the hearth was wide and flanked a smaller sword designed for a much younger hand. He reached up and took down Robbie's weapon, feeling the balance as he ran one finger along the smooth length of the blade. </p><p> He'd had it made especially for Robbie and had given it to the boy on his fourth birthday. Robbie's aunt Grace had been appalled. The MacKeage men had been impressed. Well, except for Greylen. Laird MacKeage had taken on a yearning, almost pained expression as he'd held the small weapon and looked at his three young daughters. </p><p> Robbie had immediately named his sword <i>Thunderer,</i> which was a loose translation of what Michael called his own sword, and had rushed outside to battle the bushes. Since then, with both amazement and a great deal of pride, Michael had been teaching Robbie the skills of a warrior. </p><p> Learning to wield a sword was only a small part of his lessons, but it was the most enjoyable part for Robbie. The boy was unbelievably capable, in charge not only of his young mind but of his quickly growing muscles as well. With the confidence of youth backed by an unusually keen intelligence, Robbie was fast on his way to becoming a remarkable adult. </p><p> Still, Mich...</p></p><h2>The God Delusion</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Typhon Pact: Plagues of Night (Star Trek)</h2><p>The first novel&nbsp;in a two-part Typhon Pact adventure set in the universe of <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>!<br><br>In the wake of the final Borg invasion, which destroyed entire worlds, cost the lives of sixty-three billion people, and struck a crippling blow to Starfleet, six nations adversarial to the United Federation of Planets&#x2014;the Romulan Star Empire, the Breen Confederacy, the Tholian Assembly, the Gorn Hegemony, the Tzenkethi Coalition, and the Holy Order of the Kinshaya&#x2014; joined ranks to form the Typhon Pact.

Also included is Bruce Lee's Gung Fu "scrapbook" of anecdotes on the histories and traditions of the various martial arts of China. The manuscript was completed and edited by martial arts expert John Little in cooperation with the Bruce Lee Estate.<br></p><p>This is a book that Bruce Lee began writing in 1964, but never published.

In Part One, Shimbo offers up an extended cooking-school lesson in Japanese ingredients, cooking methods, and implements, with ample advice on easy-to-find substitute ingredients and shortcut techniques. This first part also has all the basic recipes for sauces, stocks, dressings, and relishes, plus time-tested secrets of rice and noodle cookery, all of which give readers the skills to improvise and create their own Japanese meals. In Part Two, Shimbo serves up a stunning feast of Japanese dishes, from updated classics of the traditional repertoire to her own delectable creations. Here are scrumptious appetizers like Tempura Pancakes and Salmon and Vegetables in a Sweet Vinegar Marinade, clear and delicate miso soups, hearty yet refined chicken, duck, and meat entrées, delicious fish and shellfish preparations, and lots of Japan&#39;s famous sushi, rice-bowl, and noodle-bowl dishes. A chapter on the fine art of Japanese desserts rounds out the banquet. This is an indispensable book for both aficionados and home cooks eager to learn more about Japanese cuisine.</p><p>No BioWhile Asian flavors have long been fashionable in the U.S., it is perhaps the hipness of sushi and familiarity of the Tepanyaki style that have been a catalyst for the recent popularity of Japanese cuisine. The author, a veteran cooking-school instructor and food writer, offers a well-rounded introduction to the rich heritage of Japanese cooking (complete with historical, cultural and personal observations from her own childhood). "Nutrition, taste and... a spirit of innovation" are Shimbo's ambitions with this comprehensive and intriguing collection of updated classic and new recipes. Perfect for the Western cook, Shimbo's book explains traditional equipment, techniques and ingredients (although, she says, American cooking implements, and the occasional substituted ingredient, will more than suffice) and how to make such staple elements as tofu. She particularly touts the healthier aspects of Japanese cuisine and offers many simple preparations that support fast-paced lives, including Easy Simmered Chicken and Chestnuts or the quick one-pot meal of Rice, Beef, Burdock Root and Mushrooms made in a rice cooker. Shimbo doesn't disappoint the aficionado, however, with Yakitori grilling, Ponzu Sauce and a far more interesting (and healthy) rendering of ramen than the cellophane-wrapped variety. Based on Japanese home-style cooking, Shimbo's is an indispensable book for the home cook, with recipes such as Chirashizushi and her mother's Green Plum Wine. Nevertheless, Shimbo also shows a fresh modern sensibility by smartly melding Western influences in her own recipes for Clam Chowder (New England meets Edomae style), Lamb StewDwhich she enlivens with misoDand Teriyaki Chicken Roll served on a bed of greens.

Allen, Jr.</b>, is the editor of <i>Crux</i>, specializing in coverage of the Vatican and the Catholic Church and the author of a number of books on religion, including most recently <i>The Global War on Christians</i>.<p>Chapter One</p><p>The Barron Story</p><p>One charming aspect of Bishop Robert Barron&#x2019;s personality, though it is frustrating for an interviewer, is that he doesn&#x2019;t really much like talking about himself. I&#x2019;ve come to think the reason is not only genuine humility but also impatience to get on to what he thinks is the far more important element of any conversation--namely, the Catholic faith, and why it&#x2019;s the best answer to the questions that well up from every human heart.</p><p>Yet it&#x2019;s important to begin with some basics about Barron&#x2019;s life and background, not only because doing so helps us get a read on where he&#x2019;s coming from but also because it provides fodder for one of the towering questions about the ministry of evangelization: Are great evangelizers born, or made? That is to say, can the kind of missionary talent Barron possesses be taught, or do you just have to be gifted with it?</p><p>As we&#x2019;ll see, Barron&#x2019;s own answer to that question is the classic Catholic &#x201c;both/and&#x201d;--natural talent helps, he concedes, but he also firmly believes that certain techniques can be taught that will make anyone seriously interested in evangelizing better at doing it.</p><p>Also as we&#x2019;ll see, the basic &#x201c;technique&#x201d; Barron proposes is doing one&#x2019;s homework. He&#x2019;s convinced that one can&#x2019;t defend and extol the nearly two-thousand-year intellectual history of the Catholic Church without mastering it oneself. Understanding how he went about that, and what drove him to do it, may help others find their own path.</p><p>Today, an equally important component of Barron&#x2019;s life and self-understanding is his role as a bishop. Precisely because it&#x2019;s so fundamental, we&#x2019;ll cover his thoughts on that front in a separate chapter, Chapter 9).</p><p>&nbsp;<br>Childhood</p><p>Robert Emmet Barron was born on November 19, 1959, in Chicago. His father worked for John Sexton &amp; Company, a wholesale grocer and food supplier serving restaurants, hotels, and institutions, which had been founded in Chicago in 1883. Robert has a younger sister and an older brother, and he says he was especially tight with his brother growing up since their ages are only fifteen months apart. (Communications run in the Barron gene pool, since his brother would go on to become the publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times. His sister worked in PR for a while, took a break to start a family, and is today a teaching assistant in a Chicago-area high school.)</p><p>Barron says his was a &#x201c;good, solid&#x201d; Catholic family, if not overly demonstrative about their faith.</p><p>&#x201c;My parents are Catholic to the core,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;It would never in a million years occur to them not to go to Mass on Sunday. We weren&#x2019;t superprayerful . . . my parents had respect for the rosary, for example, but we didn&#x2019;t always pray it. When I was a little tiny kid, my mother would come in and pray with us before we went to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Echoes of that deep Catholic faith passed on by his parents have stayed with Barron over the years.</p><p>&#x201c;My mother gave me, and I still have it, a crucifix belonging to my uncle who was a Christian Brother, and who died many years ago. He had this pectoral cross&#x2013;type of thing that he probably tucked into his habit, and I slept with it under my pillow when I was a kid. My mother told me that was a good thing to do, and I had little prayers I&#x2019;d pray. Sunday Mass, holy days and all that, were absolutes, plus going to Catholic school and regular Confession.&#x201d;</p><p>Barron says his parents were never really part of the debates over the changes in Catholic faith and life introduced by Vatican II, content with the philosophy &#x201c;If the Church wants it, it&#x2019;s okay with me.&#x201d; Apparently, they passed that spirit on to their son.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember being trained as an altar boy, it would&#x2019;ve been about 1969, right when the novus ordo Mass came,&#x201d; he recalled. &#x201c;For us it was like, &#x2018;Oh, hey, this is a new Mass, and you guys have been trained to serve, so off we go.&#x2019; There was no sense of &#x2018;Oh, I&#x2019;m going through a rupture with the old and this is a challenging change,&#x2019; none of that. It was just like, that was the way it is.&#x201d;</p><p>The family moved to Detroit in 1963, when Barron was four, because his father&#x2019;s job took them there, and they would remain in Detroit until 1968. Among other things, it was during that period Barron acquired his lifelong love for baseball.</p><p>&#x201c;Our last year in Detroit was when the Tigers won the World Series with Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich . . . that was the era when I first learned baseball. My first professional baseball game was a Tigers game in 1967, so my earliest memories of pro baseball are the Tigers,&#x201d; Barron recalled. (Like the good Chicagoan he is, however, Barron says he cheers only for the Tigers these days only in the American League--overall, he&#x2019;s a die-hard Cubs fan.) The next year he moved back to Chicago just in time to agonize through the Cubs&#x2019; legendary collapse to the &#x201c;Miracle Mets&#x201d;--an early lesson, he now ruefully concedes, in how life often blends elation with heartbreak.</p><p>Barron&#x2019;s period in Detroit occurred in the middle of the drama in Catholicism unleashed by Vatican II, though he says he had little awareness of it at the time, despite attending a Catholic grade school. One experience from that time, however, did leave an impression.</p><p>&#x201c;When I was in third grade, the nuns went to a modified habit. I remember vividly how it caused a near riot when Sister walked into third grade and we saw her in the new habit; we all went berserk,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;We loved her. Her name was Sister Jean Marie, and she came in with the shorter veil and the dress that showed her legs, we just freaked out. That&#x2019;s a transitional memory, I suppose you could say, of moving to the postconciliar period.&#x201d;</p><p>Later on, Barron attended the Dominican-run Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, the only high school in the United States directly operated and staffed by the Dominican order. It was during that time, as an intellectually precocious teenager, that he discovered what he calls the &#x201c;two Thomases&#x201d;--Merton and Aquinas, who would become touchstones for his entire career.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s how Barron tells the story on Merton.</p><p>I worked at Kroch&#x2019;s and Brentano&#x2019;s bookstore chain. It&#x2019;s gone now, but it was a big deal at the time. There was a huge store in Chicago and about sixteen satellite stores in the area. I worked at one of the branches, and the policy was if a book got too worn out, the manager could tear the cover off and we could take it home. My brother worked there as well; he was seventeen and I was sixteen. He saw that The Seven Storey Mountain cover had been taken off, so he threw it at me and said, &#x201c;I bet you would like this. It was written by a Trappist monk.&#x201d; I said, with completely unconscious irony given Merton&#x2019;s interests later in his career, &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t want to read a book by some Buddhist.&#x201d; My brother shot back, &#x201c;Trappists are Catholics, you idiot!&#x201d; With that, literally landing in my lap was The Seven Storey Mountain. I brought this mangled book home with me, no cover, and I read it with full teenage passion . . . Merton filled in the spiritual content for me. It was like, wow, if there really is a God, you can be in relationship with him, and you can explore that friendship in all sorts of interesting ways. I read The Seven Storey Mountain like a romance novel. I loved the Beatles, and I have a very vivid memory of reading The Seven Storey Mountain with the sound track of the Beatles behind me.&#x201d;</p><p>As for Aquinas, Barron has the Dominicans to thank.</p><p>It was at Fenwick High School. I&#x2019;m a freshman and it&#x2019;s springtime, so the end of my first year. We were out at the playground horsing around, so we all come in kind of sweating, and it&#x2019;s time for religion class. We had this young Dominican, Father Thomas Paulsen. That day, he laid out for us the Aquinas arguments for the existence of God, beginning, I think, with the motion argument. There I was, a fourteen-year-old Catholic kid just going to Mass, and I still don&#x2019;t know why, but I was captivated. I think it was a movement of grace, and I&#x2019;m sure no one else in that class was all that interested. For some reason, however, it struck me as, Wow, that&#x2019;s right, that&#x2019;s correct. No one up to that point in my experience really had thought seriously about God, you just went to Mass . . . That exposure to Aquinas showed me you could actually think deeply and clearly about God. Not that I didn&#x2019;t believe in God, I did, but there was rational depth and clarity to Aquinas that hit me like a revelation.</p><p>From there, the young Barron was off to the races.</p><p>I guess it never occurred to me to go to the teacher and say, &#x201c;Hey, I want to know more,&#x201d; so I started going to the library, where I found this volume of Aquinas&#x2019;s writings in Mortimer Adler&#x2019;s Great Books series. I took it out in my little fourteen-year-old hands, and I brought it home like a treasure. I didn&#x2019;t really know what I was reading, but I knew it was wonderful. It was similar to the experience I had when I discovered Shakespeare that same year. I read Romeo and Juliet and understood precious little of it, but I thought, There should be such a thing! I just knew that Aquinas, like Shakespeare, was someone I could study for the rest of my life.</p><p>After finishing high school, Barron put in one year under the Golden Dome at the University of Notre Dame, and after discovering a vocation to the priesthood, he finished his undergraduate work at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Since his early attitudes took shape in the context of Vatican II, sorting through how the young Barron reacted to the tumult generated by the council is key to understanding what he would later become.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vatican II and Its Aftermath</p><p>Although some Catholics pine for the period before Vatican II, Barron says he&#x2019;s never shared that instinct, mostly because he&#x2019;s too young to remember the Church before the council. What he does remember with great clarity, however, is the postconciliar period of experimentation and change, and that left a deep impression on him.</p><p>&#x201c;It was the high-water mark of what I call &#x2018;banners and balloons&#x2019; Catholicism,&#x201d; Barron says.</p><p>&#x201c;When I was getting religious instruction as a young man, it was the period right after the council: 1969, &#x2019;70, &#x2019;71. We did a lot of very experiential kinds of things,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I remember vividly one of the sisters at my grade school played James Taylor&#x2019;s &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve Got a Friend,&#x2019; and told us, &#x2018;Now as you hear this song, I want you to just draw what you&#x2019;re feeling.&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;t think it was anything weird, I just did what they told me, but that was religion class. The formation was a little superficial.&#x201d;</p><p>Barron says that tendency to reimagine religion largely in terms of emotion and social relevance may have been especially pronounced in Chicago, given all that was going on during that time.</p><p>We arrived back in Chicago in August 1968, which is when the riots were going on around the Democratic convention. You had the Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Kennedy assassinations. So, the big thing when I was going to school was social justice, the rights of the marginalized, worrying about the poor. If I were to say what they taught me about the spiritual life, I&#x2019;d probably say it was a deep commitment to social justice. We got that message for sure as kids. What I reacted against, without knowing it at the time, was the reductionism. If that&#x2019;s all that the spiritual life comes down to, then we have an impoverishment on our hands.</p><p>Though Barron says he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to formulate his thoughts quite that way at the time, part of the direction his life and career would later take was in reaction to the reductionism he sensed as a youth: &#x201c;I think most of us do that, most of us kind of react to whatever we were formed in and we begin to see the other side, the shadow side of it,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>It was while studying at Catholic University in the early 1980s, under legends such as Monsignor Robert Sokolowski, Monsignor John Wippel, and Thomas Prufer, that Barron says he began to articulate to himself what his instincts told him had gone wrong.</p><p>By that time, I had begun to see there&#x2019;s a disconnect, there&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s not making sense [in some elements of how Vatican II was being implemented]. I saw that there was something relatively superficial about the liturgical dimension, for instance. There was also a tension between the way we were living the faith and the more substantial intellectual grounding we were getting at the university, and the discrepancy began to grate on me. Mind you, I arrived at Catholic U in 1979 and John Paul II had just been elected, so the &#x201c;John Paul effect&#x201d; hadn&#x2019;t happened yet. Around that time, though, it became clearer to me what the demarcations [in the Church] were.</p><p>Looking back, Barron says his reaction to the post&#x2013;Vatican II period left him with not so much opposition to the liberal Catholic project as a strong sense that on its own, liberalism is not quite enough.</p><p>What I emphasize is that I&#x2019;m not &#x201c;antiliberal,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m &#x201c;postliberal,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s on purpose. There&#x2019;s something permanently valuable in the liberal project, there&#x2019;s a critique that&#x2019;s permanently valuable. We don&#x2019;t want to reject that, but we do want to move through it on to something else . . . I&#x2019;m a [Cardinal John Henry] Newman man. He emphasized the development of unfolding things--a plant doesn&#x2019;t just uproot itself and start over again, it&#x2019;s always coming forth and sending off new branches and shoots. I believe in moments of criticism and moments of new growth, but not of rupture. That&#x2019;s my own experience of learning to be in the Church.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paris</p><p>Barron was ordained to the priesthood in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, who had taken over from the flamboyant Cardinal John Cody in 1982 (once described by Father Andrew Greeley, a novelist and sociologist, as a &#x201c;madcap tyrant&#x201d;). Barron met Cody only twice, once as a young man when Cody gave him a John Paul II key chain, and the second time toward the end of Cody&#x2019;s life when he visited Catholic University and Barron and a fellow student picked him up at the airport. As they drove by the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, he remembers Cody telling him, &#x201c;I built that place!&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2><p>The fourth book in this wildly popular series finds Harry Potter back with his muggle relatives, the Dursleys, where he has just had a very disturbing "dream" involving his mortal enemy Voldemort, the sorcerer who killed his parents years earlier. When he finds his signature lightning bolt scar aching, he suspects it was more than just a dream, so he sends a letter to his godfather Sirius Black, who remains in hiding. As usual, Harry can hardly wait for the school year to begin so he can escape his mean and exceedingly nasty relations and return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Relief from the Dursleys comes two weeks early when Harry is invited to attend the Quidditch World Cup as a guest of the Weasley family. New adventures await Harry at the World Cup and back at Hogwarts, where once again he faces mortal danger from Voldemort. When Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger arrive at Hogwarts, they soon discover that surprises are in store: Quidditch matches have been canceled in lieu of a very special international tournament, they have a new Master of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Hagrid has obtained some new and rather disgusting specimens for the Care of Magical Creatures class, and Harry develops a crush on fellow Hogwarts student Cho Chang.<p><b>No Canadian Rights for the Harry Potter Series</b></p><p>HARRY POTTER and all related characters and elements are trademarks of and � Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Harry Potter publishing rights � J. K. Rowling. (s05)</p></p><p>In <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

It seemed all might be lost in the Middle East, while collapse seemed inevitable in Russia. Yet at this crucial time, America and Britain began to work together, and it was this alliance of the weary combatant and naive newcomer, fighting shoulder to shoulder under shared command for the first time in North Africa, that would eventually lead to the defeat of the Axis powers in the west.<p>Whilst drawing on a wide range of archival material from around the world and offering new perspectives and analysis to a critical period of World War II, <em>Together We Stand</em> is also about the men and women who found themselves caught up in this struggle, people drawn from all parts of the globe, from all ranks and services, to make up these polyglot Allied forces.</p><p>From the heat and dust of the Western Desert to the mud and mountains of Northern Tunisia, Holland retells the remarkable stories of these brave soldiers and charts the extraordinary first days of an alliance that has worked together ever since.</p></p><p>James Holland is a British historian and journalist. He is the author of <i>Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege 1940-1943</i>. He lives in England.After years of relative neglect, historians of WWII are rediscovering the savage fighting in North Africa and developing a renewed appreciation of its importance. Rick Atkinson's superb <i>An Army at Dawn</i> (2002) approached the subject from an American perspective. Now comes British journalist and historian Holland with a compelling and detailed account of the same campaign. Holland (<i>Fortress Malta</i>) picks up in 1942, following two years of desultory fighting in the North African desert. The decision of the Anglo-American alliance to invade Northwest Africa first&#x2014;instead of France&#x2014;transformed the desert campaign into a major front. Early fighting favored the Axis since the British suffered from "interwar apathy" and inferior equipment, and the Americans were also plagued by inexperience, inadequate training and poor leadership. But the Allies learned from their setbacks and eventually drove the Axis out of Africa. Despite personality clashes, the Americans and the British learned to collaborate, setting the stage for "the strongest military alliance in history." Entertaining though scholarly, this exhaustively researched narrative moves seamlessly from the exalted strategy conferences of generals and presidents to the individual grunt on the front line, offering as complete a portrait of this important episode in WWII as we are likely to see. <i>(Feb. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The discovery of skeletal remains still bearing a long dark braid of hair opens deep wounds among the Native Americans who live on Wyoming's Wind River reservation. Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden's efforts to identify the woman, apparently a murder victim, cause tension with her love interest and law partner, Adam Lone Eagle, driving her to enlist the aid of their friend Fr. John O'Malley. A rash of threats and the murder of a woman Vicky questioned confirms her suspicions that members of a 1970s activist group, the American Indian Movement, are still on the rez and somehow involved in all the happenings. Bringing her trademark western flair to nonstop action, Coel keeps danger hanging over Vicky's head as she follows a trail of clues to their startling conclusion. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Jones recalls over half a century of bird hunting. But his are not simply hunting tales. Jones writes about the birds he loves - woodcock, grouse, prairie chickens, Canada geese, and others - and a way of life he treasures with graceful authority. His reverence, humor, and dead-on precision will indelibly touch not only those who embrace the sport, but anyone who appreciates superb writing. These essays remind us that Jones is among the sporting world's finest contemporary voices. (6 1/4 X 9 1/4, 196 pages, illustrations)<br>A medley of well-crafted essays and short stories highlights one man's lifelong love affair with bird hunting. Jones, a novelist and former Sports Illustrated staffer, writes for hunting magazines like Sports Afield and Gray's Sporting Journal. No surprise, then, that much of his nonfiction reads less like essays than magazine articles. But even the most topical, how- to piece, like ``America's Bird,'' mixes history, ornithology, and autobiography with Jones's turkey hunting dos and don'ts, adding a savory-sounding recipe for roast wild gobbler to boot. ``D-Day In Maryland'' surpasses simple instruction to capture the mythic atmosphere and tradition of wingshooting at a Chesapeake Bay hunting club. So skillfully does it pinpoint the delicious anticipation of opening day, when ``like a kid on the cusp of summer vacation, you can look ahead to a whole long string of seemingly endless weeks,'' that it might serve as an exemplar for the sporting essay, which exists primarily to help hunters through the long dark night of the soul known as off-season. The two short stories, ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'' and ``In the Drowned Lands,'' though mere tales, crackle with crisp action and keen description, signifying authority of experience. Jones touches all the bases the sporting genre demands--his writing is chock-full of larger-than-life characters, both human and canine; he pays due to the aesthetics of the hunt: the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction mingled with regret when a bird is brought to hand. Yet a preoccupation with the kill risks marring the book with a stunted, adolescent feel by creating the misconception that Jones hasn't outgrown the stage of hunting that measures success by body count, rather than quality of time spent afield. A trifle bloodthirsty, but lively and genuine. (line art) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As the first employee of a fledgling media startup in 1955, Phil worked his way up over a 40-year span, as Capital Cities grew to become one of America's most influential and successful media companies. Limping on Water is a Dickensian rags-to-riches tale of a disadvantaged boy, born with cerebral palsy who, through luck, pluck, strength of character, skill, persistence and loyalty, rose to become a top executive at one of America's most respected and successful media companies, Capital Cities Communications; "The minnow that swallowed the whale." Phil was born in a blue-collar neighborhood of Staten Island to parents of English and German stock in 1932. To state that his origins were humble is like saying the Yankees know a thing or two about baseball. The young struggling family was crushed by the tragic death of Phil's father when Phil was just four, causing his mother to park her young, physically impaired son with her step-father, an embittered, war-wounded veteran (of the Spanish-American War!), who ran a ramshackle "Sanford and Son" junk business out of his backyard.

Hence only those works which satisfy both our temperaments and our minds arouse our unqualified admiration. The failure to make this fundamental distinction is a great cause of injustice.</p><p>&#x2014;Preface to Derni�res chansons by Louis Bouilhet</p><p>&#x201c;The death of Lucien de Rubempr� is the great drama of my life,&#x201d; Oscar Wilde is said to have remarked about one of Balzac&#x2019;s characters. I have always regarded this statement as being literally true. A handful of fictional characters have marked my life more profoundly than a great number of the flesh-and-blood beings I have known. Although there is no denying that when literary characters and human beings are an immediate presence, a direct contact, the reality of the latter prevails over that of the former&#x2014;nothing is as alive as the body that can be seen and touched&#x2014;the difference disappears when both become part of the past, of memory, to the considerable advantage of the first over the second, whose fading in our minds is irremediable, whereas the fictional character can be brought to life indefinitely, merely by opening the pages of the book and stopping at the right lines. In that heterogeneous, cosmopolitan circle, a gang of friendly ghosts whose members come and go, depending on the period of my life and my mood (today I might mention, offhand: D&#x2019;Artagnan, David Copperfield, Jean Valjean, Prince Pierre Bezukhov, Fabrice del Dongo, the terrorists Cheng and the Professor, Lena Grove and the tall convict); none of them has been present as persistently, and with none of them have I had as clearly passionate a relationship, as Emma Bovary. That story may perhaps serve as a small example that will help to shed light on the much-discussed, enigmatic relationships between literature and life.</p><p>My first memory of Madame Bovary is cinematographic. It was 1952, a stifling-hot summer night, a recently opened movie theater in Piura, on the Plaza de Armas with its waving palms; James Mason appeared as Flaubert; Louis Jourdan, tall and svelte, was Rodolphe Boulanger; and Emma Bovary took on visible form by way of the nervous movements and gestures of Jennifer Jones. I couldn&#x2019;t have been terribly impressed, because the film didn&#x2019;t cause me to rush out and hunt up a copy of the book, despite the fact that it was at precisely this period in my life that I&#x2019;d begun to stay up nights devouring novels like a cannibal.</p><p>My second memory is academic. On the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Madame Bovary, the University of San Marcos, in Lima, organized a ceremony in honor of the occasion, in the main auditorium. The critic Andr� Coyn� was impassively considering Flaubert&#x2019;s reputation as a realist when his arguments suddenly became inaudible amid shouts of &#x201c;Long live free Algeria!&#x201d; and the war cries of a hundred or so San Marcos students, armed with sticks and stones, as they made their way through the hall toward the platform where their target, the French ambassador, awaited them, white as a sheet. Part of the celebration in honor of Flaubert was the publication, in a little booklet whose ink rubbed off on our fingers, of Saint Julien l&#x2019;Hospitalier, in a translation by Manuel Beltroy. That was the first work of Flaubert&#x2019;s I ever read.</p><p>In the summer of 1959 I arrived in Paris with very little money and the promise of a scholarship. One of the first things I did was to buy a copy of Madame Bovary in the Classiques Garnier edition, in a bookstore in the Latin Quarter. I began reading it that very afternoon, in a tiny room in the H�tel Wetter, near the Mus�e Cluny. It is at this point that my story really begins. From the very first lines, the book&#x2019;s power of persuasion was like an extremely potent magic spell. It had been years since any novel had vampirized my attention so quickly, blotted out my physical surroundings so completely, plunged me so deeply into the story it told. As the afternoon wore on, as night fell, as dawn began to break, the magical decantation, the substitution of the fictional world for the real one, held me spellbound. Morning had already come&#x2014;Emma and L�on had just met in a box at the Rouen opera&#x2014;when, dizzy with fatigue, I put the book down and went to bed: in my troubled sleep at that hour the Rouaults&#x2019; farm, the muddy streets of Tostes, the figure of Charles, good-natured and stupid, the ponderous pedantry of Homais (who might well have been Argentine) continued to exist, as vividly as when I&#x2019;d been reading about them&#x2014;and above these persons and these places, like an image foreshadowed in a thousand childhood dreams, dimly glimpsed from the moment I&#x2019;d begun devouring books so avidly in adolescence, there hovered the face of Emma Bovary. As I woke up so as to go on reading, two certainties flashed through my mind, like two bolts of lightning: I now knew what writer I would have liked to be; and I knew that from that moment on, till my dying day, I would be in love with Emma Bovary. In the future she would be for me, as for L�on Dupuis in the first days of their affair, &#x201c;the beloved of every novel, the heroine of every play, the vague she of every volume of verse.&#x201d;</p><p>Since then I have read the novel from beginning to end half a dozen times and reread various chapters and episodes again and again. Unlike what has happened to me on going back to other cherished stories, I have never been disappointed; on the contrary, especially on rereading those scenes that are volcanic craters&#x2014;the agricultural fair, the ride in the fiacre, Emma&#x2019;s death&#x2014;I have always had the sensation that I was discovering secret facets, unpublished details, and, to varying degrees depending on the place and the circumstances, I have always felt precisely the same emotion. A book becomes part of a person&#x2019;s life for a number of reasons appertaining at once to the book and the person. I should like to explore what some of these reasons are in my case: why Madame Bovary stirred me to such profound depths of my being, what it gave me that other stories could not.</p><p>The first reason is, surely, my particular penchant, ever since childhood, for works that are rigorously and symmetrically constructed, with a definite beginning and a definite end, that form a closed circle and gave the impression of being perfect, finished works, in preference to those open-ended works deliberately aimed at suggesting something inconclusive, vague, in the process of becoming, only half over and done with. It is possible that these latter works are more faithful images of reality and of life&#x2014;always unfinished, ever at some halfway point between this and that&#x2014;but what I have doubtless sought instinctively and been pleased to find in books, films, paintings has not been the reflection of this infinite incompleteness, this boundless ongoing flow, but rather the exact opposite: definitive overviews, wholes which, thanks to their bold structure, arbitrary yet convincing, give the illusion of being a total picture of reality, of summing up all of life. That appetite was to be fully satisfied by Madame Bovary, the very exemplar of the closed work, of the book that is a perfect circle. On the other hand, an increasing preference, which up to that point in my reading had nonetheless remained quite vague, must have taken definite shape thanks to this novel. Between the description of objective life and subjective life, of action and reflection, I am more attracted by the former than by the latter, and I have always considered the description of the latter by way of the former a more impressive feat than the converse (I prefer Tolstoy to Dostoevsky, invention rooted in reality to that rooted in fantasy, and if I am left to choose between unrealities, the one closer to the concrete has my preference over the one that is abstract: I prefer pornography, for example, to science fiction, and sentimental stories to horror tales). In his letters to Louise Colet while in the throes of writing Madame Bovary, Flaubert was quite certain that he was composing a novel of &#x201c;ideas,&#x201d; not a novel of &#x201c;action&#x201d; with a lively plot. This has led certain critics who have taken his words literally to maintain that Madame Bovary is a novel in which nothing happens except on the level of language. But this is not so; in Madame Bovary as many things happen as in an adventure novel&#x2014;weddings, acts of adultery, balls, journeys, outings, financial skulduggery, sicknesses, theatrical spectacles, a suicide&#x2014;even though for the most part these events turn out to be inconsequential or sordid ones. It is true that many of these happenings are narrated as seen through the emotions or the recollected memories of the character involved, but because of Flaubert&#x2019;s maniacally materialistic style, the subjective reality in Madame Bovary is possessed of a solidity, a physical weight, as palpable as that of objective reality. The impression that the thoughts and the feelings in the novel were facts, so concrete that they could be seen and almost touched, not only dazzled me: it revealed to me a profound predilection on my part.</p><p>These are formal reasons, stemming from the structure and conception of the book. Those concerning its subject matter are less invertebrate. The greater the role that rebellion, violence, melodrama, and sex, expertly combined in a compact plot, have played in a novel, the greater its appeal has been to me. In other words, the maximum satisfaction that a novel can bring me is to arouse, as I read, my admiration for this or that revolt against the established order, my anger at some stupidity or injustice, my fascination for melodramatic situations, for excessive displays of emotion that romanticism seemed to have invented, since it both used and abused them, though they have always existed in literature, as they have doubtless always existed in reality and in my secret desire. Madame Bovary is chock-full of these ingredients, they are the four great rivers that irrigate its vast geography, and the distribution of these contents in the novel reveals the same careful balance of its formal division into sections, chapters, scenes, dialogues, and descriptions.</p><p>Rebellion in Emma&#x2019;s case does not have the epic dimensions of that of the masculine heroes of the nineteenth-century novel, yet it is no less heroic. Hers is the rebellion of an individual, and to all appearances a self-centered one: she violates the codes of her milieu because she is driven to do so by problems that are hers alone, not in the name of all humanity, of a certain ethic or ideology. It is because she feels that society is fettering her imagination, her body, her dreams, her appetites that Emma suffers, commits adultery, lies, steals, and in the end kills herself. Her defeat does not prove that she is wrong and the bourgeois of Yonville-l&#x2019;Abbaye right, that God punishes her for her sins, as was maintained by Ma�tre S�nard, the attorney for the defense at the trial of Madame Bovary (his defense of the novel is as pharisaical as the accusation against it put before the court by Pinard, the public prosecutor, a composer in secret of pornographic verses), but simply proof that the battle was one-sided: Emma was alone, and because she was an impulsive and sentimental creature, continually inclined to go astray, to become more and more deeply enmeshed in situations that in the end gave her enemy the advantage (setting forth arguments doubtless suggested to him by Flaubert himself, Ma�tre S�nard assured the judges at the trial that the moral of the novel is: Dangers lie ahead for a girl who receives an education superior to that of her class). This defeat, foredoomed due to the conditions governing the battle, takes on the overtones both of genuine tragedy and of a cheap newspaper serial, and that is one of the mixtures of genres to which&#x2014;poisoned, like Emma, by certain books I read and movies I saw when I was an adolescent&#x2014;I am most likely to succumb.</p><p>But it is not only the fact that Emma is capable of defying her milieu&#x2014;family, class, society&#x2014;but also the causes of her defiance that force me to admire that elusive little nobody. These causes are very simple and stem from something that she and I share intimately: our incurable materialism, our greater predilection for the pleasures of the body than for those of the soul, our respect for the senses and instinct, our preference for this earthly life over any other. The ambitions that lead Emma to sin and death are precisely those that Western religion and morality have most savagely combated throughout history. Emma wants sexual pleasure, she is not resigned to repressing this profound sensual need that Charles is unable to satisfy because he doesn&#x2019;t even know that it exists; she wants to surround her life with pleasing and superfluous things, elegance, refinement, to give concrete form by way of objects to that appetite for beauty that her imagination, her sensibility, and her reading have aroused in her. Emma wants to know other worlds, other people; she refuses to reconcile herself to the prospect of spending the rest of her days hemmed in by the narrow horizons of Yonville; and she also wants her existence to be different and exciting, to ensure that adventure and risk, the magnificent gestures of generosity and sacrifice, will play a role in it. Emma&#x2019;s rebellion is born of one conviction, the root of all her acts: I am not resigned to my lot, the dubious compensation of the beyond doesn&#x2019;t matter to me, I want my life to be wholly and completely fulfilled here and now. A chimera no doubt lies at the heart of the destiny to which Emma aspires, above all if it becomes a collective pattern, a common human goal. No society can offer all its members such an existence; it is evident, moreover, that in order for communal life to be possible man must resign himself to keeping a close rein on his desires, to limiting that will to transgress that Georges Bataille called Evil. But Emma represents and defends, in an exemplary way, a side of our humanity that has been cruelly disavowed by almost all religions, philosophies, and ideologies, and made out by them to be a cause for shame shared by our entire species. Its repression has given rise to as great and as widespread unhappiness as have economic exploitation, religious sectarianism, or the thirst for conquest. With the passage of time, ever broader and broader sectors of society&#x2014;including even the Church today&#x2014;have come to recognize that man has the right to satisfy his hunger, to think and to express his ideas freely, to enjoy good health and a secure old age. But the same taboos as in Emma Bovary&#x2019;s day still hold sway (and in this regard the right and the left are in total agreement and work hand in glove to enforce them)&#x2014;taboos that universally deny men and women the right to pleasure, to the fulfillment of their desires. The story of Emma is that of a blind, stubborn, desperate rebellion against the social violence that stifles this right.</p><p>I remember having read, in the opening pages of a book by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, that violence is almost always beautiful as an image, that is to say, in art, and having felt more or less reassured thereby. I was seventeen years old at the time, and it frightened me to note that despite my peaceful nature, violence&#x2014;whether implicit or explicit, refined or raw&#x2014;was an indispensable requisite for a novel if it was to persuade me of its reality and arouse my enthusiasm. Those works that did not possess at least a little taste of violence seemed unreal to me (I have always preferred novels that pretend to be real, just as others prefer novels that pre...</p></p><h2>A Long Way From Chicago</h2><p>Newberry Award winner!

Like many ideals, this one was freighted with many meanings. As the colony grew in the seventeenth century, the belief in religious liberty and freedom of conscience espoused by its founder, Roger Williams, led to the development of political liberty and practical democracy. In the eighteenth century, that dedication to individualism made Rhode Islanders into businessmen of the first order, willing to take the big risk in hope of a bigger reward. Their land being poor in natural resources, Rhode Islanders turned to trade; accumulating wealth from traffic in rum and slaves, they built in Newport and Providence small but elegant copies of Georgian England, and worried more about taxes and currency than about religion. When they felt poorly served by British policies, they became ready revolutionaries and led in the founding of a new nation. After the Civil War, their children took individual liberty to mean economic laissez-faire, ushering in the state's golden age when Rhode Island senator Nelson Aldrich became known as the "general manager" of the United States.<br> <br> Through countless changes in the twentieth century, the ideal still survives and asks old questions of new generations of Rhode Islanders from many ethnic backgrounds: How best to reconcile the rights of minorities with the rule of the majority, and how best to secure the individual liberty and economic opportunity that Roger Williams and Moses Brown would have understood so well?</p><p>High atop the Rhode Island capitol in Providence, a bronze likeness of &#34;&#34;The Independent Man&#34;&#34; keeps watch over a state that historically has put the ideal of individual liberty before all others.

As Taoism emerges as one of the East Asian philosophies most interesting to Westerners, an accessible new edition of this great work&#x2015;written for English-language readers, yet rendered with an eye toward Chinese understanding&#x2015;has been much needed by scholars and general readers.<br><br>Richard John Lynn, whose recent translation of the<i>I Ching</i> was hailed by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> as "the best <i>I Ching</i> that has so far appeared," presents here another fine translation. Like his <i>I Ching,</i> this volume includes the interpretive commentary of the third-century scholar Wang Bi (226-249), who wrote the first and most sophisticated commentary on the <i>Tao-te Ching.</i><br><br>Lynn's introduction explores the centrality of Wang's commentaries in Chinese thought, the position of the <i>Tao-te Ching</i> in East Asian tradition, Wang's short but brilliant life, and the era in which he lived. The text consists of eighty-one short, aphoristic sections presenting a complete view of how the sage rules in accordance with the spontaneous ways of the natural world. Although the <i>Tao-te Ching</i> was originally designed to provide advice to the ruler, the Chinese regard its teachings as living and self-cultivation tools applicable to anyone. Wang Bi's commentaries, following each statement, flesh out the text so that it speaks to the modern Western reader as it has to Asians for more than seventeen centuries.</p><p>At last, the most influential book of Taoist tradition is available in an edition that allows English-language readers to experience it the way Chinese readers have for centuries.

Though the stories are not based on fact, they address issues considered prevalent at the turn of the century, and attempt to reflect Wilder's feelings and attitudes regarding them. In the first book, Laura seeks support to preserve the county's forests. In the second title, she confronts prejudice and ignorance while trying to convince farmers to obey the law by sending their children to school. Other topics discussed briefly in the stories include freedom of the press, immigration to America, and the country's industrialization. Tedrow captures the essence of the time period by authentically describing the setting, depicting believable characters and examining problems that are still relevant today. What might be more relevant, however, is the fact that both author and publisher appear to be capitalizing on a successful segment of Americana; the series will strike many adults as a rip-off.

Introduction by Walter Hooper.<br></p><p>"Lewis gives us permission to admit our own doubts, our own angers and anguishes, and to know that they are part of the soul's growth."--Madeleine L'Engle &nbsp; All but two of the essays here first appeared in newspapers and magazines, and although their subjects are wide ranging, they all share an infusion of C.S. Lewis's characteristic sanity and persuasiveness. In those essays written between 1940 and 1945, Lewis reflects on questions generated by the war: Democratic values, the need for updated chivalry, and the cynicism of the modern soldier. Other essays examine the threats to educational and spiritual fulfillment, the prolems of literary censorship, and the very survival of humanity as we know it. &nbsp; C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) gained international renown for an impressive array of beloved works both popular and scholarly: literary criticism, children's literature, fantasy literature, and numerous books on theology. Among his most celebrated achievements are <i>Out of the Silent Planet, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, The Four Loves, </i>and <i>Surprised by Joy</i>.C. S. (Clive Staples) Lewis (1898-1963), one of the great writers of the twentieth century,&nbsp;also&nbsp;continues to be one of our most influential Christian thinkers. A Fellow and tutor at Oxford until 1954, he spent the rest of his career as Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge. He wrote more than thirty books, both popular and scholarly, inlcuding&nbsp;The Chronicles of Narnia series, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, <em>The Four Loves</em>, <em>Mere Christianity </em>and <em>Surprised by Joy</em>.</p><h2>The Sea Inside</h2><p><b>A yearlong adventure through the world&#x2019;s oceans with Philip Hoare, the award-winning author of <i>The Whale</i><br></b><br>In colorful prose and lively line drawings, Hoare sets out to rediscover the sea and its islands, birds, and beasts.

P.C. Doherty) built around Kathryn Swinbrooke, physician and herbalist in 15th-century Canterbury. Edward of York and his beautiful Queen Elizabeth Woodville rule in the aftermath of civil war, but Elizabeth feels threatened by the spells and secrets held by her necromancer (and blackmailer) Tenebrae in his journal--The Book of Shadows. When Tenebrae is found murdered in his black mansion in Canterbury, Kathryn is called to the scene. She finds a locked-room scenario in which those present at the time of the magus's death, composed of a group from a London goldsmith's guild whom Tenebrae saw one by one, appear innocent, but the infamous Book of Shadows has vanished. Kathryn's Irish love, Colum Murtagh, the King's Commissioner in Canterbury, is under pressure from Queen Elizabeth to recover the book and identify the murderer. Together, they talk to everyone involved--from Tenebrae's servants Morel and Bogbean to Sir Raymond Hetherington, physician Brissot, rich widow Dauncey, clerk Fronsac, and others of the London party. When members of that group begin to turn up dead, Kathryn returns to Tenebrae's house, risking her life but eventually coming up with an inspired solution. The author's medieval mix as before--repetitious catalogues of the city's sights, sounds and smells; much good-natured chatter with Kathryn's lusty cook Thomasins; a surfeit of local ``characters'' and ailing patients, and an unconvincing killer. Of possible interest to devotees of the period--for others, mostly tedium. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>It is summer 1471, and devout pilgrims are heading for Canterbury to pray before the bones of St. Thomas a Becket. In this brisk, sharply-etched and often startling mystery (the fourth in the series featuring Kathryn Swinbrooke, physician), the pious travelers are accompanied by tradesmen, beggars, mountebanks and, again, a murderer. Tenebrae, the thoroughly evil warlock, has been killed. No one, from his unsavory servants to the Queen, regrets his death. But his volume of The Book of Shadows, which dates from Roman times and holds secrets of magic-and damaging information invaluable to blackmailers-has been stolen. Kathryn (last seen in The Merchant of Death), a leech and apothecary who cares for the ill only with a mixture of compassion, common sense and her own potions, is also licensed by the city to investigate questionable deaths. Bolstered by influential friends Colum Murtagh (the King's Commissioner) and Simon Luberon (clerk to the Archbishop of Canterbury), she zeroes in on an apparently respectable guild of goldsmiths who had had appointments with Tenebrae on the morning of his death. The ensuing investigation is swift and penetrating. Played out against the vibrant and gritty life of 15th-century Canterbury, it yields a tale that is as focused as it is shocking. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries</h2><p>This classic on the subject is dedicated to two people who greatly influenced the author W.B. Yeats and AE, perhaps the greatest mystic and visionary of this century.</p><p>What are fairies, those romantic and sometimes mischievous little people-- pixies, nixies, elves, fauns, brownies, dwarfs, leprechauns, and all the other forms of the daoine sidhe (fairy people)? Are they real? Folklorists say they are fragments of ancient religious beliefs; occultists call them nature spirits; the peasant tradition says they are fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved or bad enough to be lost. <p>Dr. Evans-Wentz is best known as the author-translator of "The Tibetan Book of the Dead", but his first love was this book, which presents a body of tradition and testimony about an elusive order of life that survives in the natural setting of wild and lonely places. He was not satisfied with merely formal study, but collected first-hand reports of fairies in Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Brittany, and faced up to the key questions avoided by other folklorists. Dr. Evans-Wentz, whose journeys led him from the haunts of fairyland to the wilderness of Tibet, opens a path for us to the luminous reality behind the traditions of folklore.</p>Evans-Wents, Jesus College Oxford.<br><br>W. Y. Evans-Wentz, an anthropologist, had interest in exploring the religious experience of mankind. His famous books in the present series include Tibetion Yoga and Secret Doctrines; The Tibetan Book of the Dead; and Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa. Evans-Wentz firmly believed that humanity is one family, eternally transcending geographical demarcations, national limitations, and every fettering concept born of the unenlightened mind.<br><br>TERRY EVANS was born in Texas, not far from the border with Mexico.

His hero, Smithy Ide, is in the grand tradition of Ignatius J. Reilly of <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> and Quoyle of <i>The Shipping News</i>. What these gentlemen have in common is their lumpen-loser looks, their outsider status and their general befuddlement about the way the world works and their place in it. Smithy rises above them because of his self-effacing nature, his great capacity for love, his inability to show it and his endless willingness to forgive. <p> Smithy is a 279-pound, hard-drinking, chain-smoking, 43-year-old misfit who works in a G.I. Joe factory putting arms and legs on the action heroes. (How did McLarty come up with that?) He is also the most beguiling anti-hero to come into view in a long, long time. McLarty, an award-winning actor and playwright best known for his many appearances on TV in <i>Law &amp; Order</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i>, <i>The Practice</i>, and <i>Judging Amy</i>, has added another star to his creative crown with this novel.</p><p> The first sentence of the book is: "My parents' Ford station wagon hit a concrete divider on U.S. 95 outside Biddeford, Maine, in August 1990." This tragic accident eventually claims both their lives. It is on the day of their funeral that Smithy finds a letter to his father about Bethany, his beloved and deeply troubled sister, stating that, "Bethany Ide, 51, died from complications of exposure... and she has since that time been in the Los Angeles Morgue West." Beautiful Bethany, given to taking off her clothes in public places, holding impossible poses for long periods of time, responding to voices that only she can hear, and disappearing for no known reason. This time, she has been gone for many years and now Smithy knows that she died destitute and alone. When he reads the letter, he is drunk, grief-stricken and, despite a house full of people, he is alone. He goes out to the garage to smoke and have another drink and spies his old Raleigh bicycle. He sits on it, flat tires and all, wheels it to the end of the driveway--and--Smithy doesn&#x2019;t know it yet, but he is going to ride a bicycle from Maine to Los Angeles to claim his sister's remains.</p><p> On the road he meets the good, the bad, and the really bad. He frequently calls Norma, the Ides' across-the-street neighbor, confined to a wheelchair for years, and always in love with him. He has never acknowledged nor returned her ardor, but he starts to count on her friendship during his travels. Their conversations are sweet and revelatory.

Like new. Pages are tightly bound, slight shelf wear.</p><p></p><h2>The Happiness Hypothesis: Putting Ancient Wisdom and Philosophy to the Test of Modern Science</h2><p>Every culture rests on a bedrock of folk wisdom handed down through generations. The pronouncements of philosophers are homespun by our grandmothers, and find their way into our common sense: what doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger. Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Happiness comes from within. But are these &#39;truths&#39; really true? Today we all seem to prefer to cling to the notion that a little bit more money, love or success will make us truly happy. Are we wrong? In &#34;The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt exposes traditional wisdom to the scrutiny of modern science, delivering startling insights. We learn that virtue is often not its own reward, why extroverts really are happier than introverts, and why conscious thought is not as important as we might like to think...Drawing on the rich inspiration of both philosophy and science, &#34;The Happiness Hypothesis&#34; is a remarkable, original and provocative book - ancient wisdom in our time.</p><p>Jonathan Haidt teaches psychology at the University of Virginia. This is his first book for the general reader. Visit the website at http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/From Chapter 6: Love and Attachments <p><i>No one can live happily who has regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his own utility; you must live for your neighbor, if you would live for yourself.</i> (Seneca) </p><p><i>No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.</i> (John Donne) </p><p>In 1931, at the age of four, my father was diagnosed with polio. He was immediately put into an isolation room at the local hospital in Brooklyn, New York. There was no cure and no vaccine for polio at that time, and city dwellers lived in fear of its spread. So for several weeks my father had no human contact, save for an occasional visit by a masked nurse. His mother came to see him every day, but that&#x2019;s all she could do &#x2013; wave to him and try to talk to him through the glass pane on the door. My father remembers calling out to her, begging her to come in. It must have broken her heart, and one day she ignored the rules and went in. She was caught and sternly reprimanded. My father recovered with no paralysis, but this image has always stayed with me: a small boy alone in a room, looking at his mother through the glass. </p><p>My father had the bad luck to be born at the confluence point of three big ideas. The first was germ theory, proposed in the 1840s by Ignaz Semmelweis and incorporated into hospitals and homes with gradually increasing ferocity over the next century. Pediatricians in the 1920s came to fear germs above all else as they began to collect statistics from orphanages and foundling homes. As far back as records went, they showed that most children dropped off at foundling homes died within one year. In 1915, a New York physician, Henry Chapin, reported to the American Pediatric Society that out of the ten foundling homes he had examined, in all but one of them <i>all</i> of the children had died before their second birthday. As pediatricians came to grips with the deadly effects of institutions on young children, they reacted in a logical way by launching a crusade against germs. It became a priority in orphanages and hospitals to isolate children as much as possible in clean cubicles, to prevent them from infecting each other. Beds were separated, dividers were placed between beds, nurses retreated behind masks and gloves, and mothers were scolded for violating quarantine. </p><p>The other two big ideas were psychoanalysis and behaviorism. These two theories agreed on very little, but they both agreed that the infant&#x2019;s attachment to its mother is based on milk. Freud thought that the infant&#x2019;s libido (desire for pleasure) is first satisfied by the breast, and therefore the infant develops its first attachment (psychological need) to the breast. Only gradually does the child generalize that desire to the woman who owns the breast. The behaviorists didn&#x2019;t care about libido, but they too saw the breast as the first reinforcer, the first reward (milk) for the first behavior (sucking). The very heart of behaviorism, if it had one, was conditioning &#x2013; the idea that learning occurs when rewards are <i>conditional</i> upon behaviors. So unconditional love -- holding, nuzzling, and cuddling children for no reason -- was seen as the surest way to make children lazy, spoiled, and weak. Freudians and behaviorists were united in their belief that highly affectionate mothering damages children, and that scientific principles could improve child rearing. Three years before my father entered the hospital, John Watson, the leading American behaviorist (in the years before B. F. Skinner), published the best seller <i>Psychological Care of Infant and Child</i>. Watson wrote of his dream that one day babies would be raised in baby farms, away from the corrupting influences of parents. But until that day arrived, parents were urged to use behaviorist techniques to rear strong children: don&#x2019;t pick them up when they cry, don&#x2019;t cuddle or coddle them, just dole out benefits and punishments for each good and bad action. </p><p>How could science have gotten it so wrong? How could doctors and psychologists not have seen that children need love as well as milk? This chapter is about that need &#x2013; the need for other people, for touch, and for close relationships. No man, woman, or child is an island. Scientists have come a long way since John Watson, and there is now a much more humane science of love. The story of this science begins with orphans and rhesus monkeys, and ends with a challenge to the dismal view of love held by many of the ancients, East and West. The heroes of this story are two psychologists who rejected the central tenets of their training: Harry Harlow and John Bowlby. These two men knew that something was missing in behaviorism and in psychoanalysis, respectively. Against great odds they changed their fields, they humanized the treatment of children, and they made it possible for science to greatly improve upon the wisdom of the ancients.</p></p><h2>Devils Advocate</h2><p>A dying English priest is dispatched from Rome as a canonical inquisitor in order to investigate the cult of sainthood that has grown around Giacomo Nerone in the desolate town of Calabria in Southern Italy.

Lord Peter Wimsey bent down over General Fentiman and drew the Morning Post gently away from the gnarled old hands. Then, with a quick jerk, he lifted the quiet figure. It came up all of a piece, stiff as a wooden doll ...But how did the general die? Who was the mysterious Mr X who fled when he was wanted for questioning? And which of the general&#39;s heirs, both members of the Bellona Club, is lying?</p><p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia to be her best work. She died in 1957.No one has mastered the snappy comeback like Lord Peter Wimsey. It's worth reading a Dorothy Sayers mystery just to hear what the silver-tongued sleuth will come out with next. In this adventure, 90-year-old General Fentiman is found dead in a wing chair at his London club. But how long has he been stiff under that newspaper? The timing means half a million pounds to someone. Ian Carmichael is Peter Wimsey. With perfect timing and vocal inflection, he ekes every bit of humor out of Wimsey that is possible to get while still maintaining the detective's effete, ever so aristocratic intelligence. While doing a dandy job with all the rest of the characters, it's really Peter and the faithful Bunter who shine here.

A graphic revelation of what happens when "free" trade overruns local markets, eradicates local economies, and creates dependence on foreign charity.</p></p><p>Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president of Haiti in 1990, and in 1991 he was forced into exile during a coup. With help from the UN, Aristide returned to Haiti to complete the remaining term of his presidency. He continues the work he began in the 80s through the Aristide Foundation for Democracy and Lafanmi Selavi, the center for street children he founded.Aristide, the former priest-turned-president of one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere, calls these nine brief chapters a letter written for "my brothers and sisters in Haiti who cannot write"Aan attempt to explain to readers that the world's richest countries are "accumulating wealth with breathtaking speed and never looking back," while the poor nations are "sinking deeper into economic misery." He views every topic he addressesAglobalization, colonialism, education, women's statusAthrough the stark lens of the poorest Haitians. Although his hope-filled vision can offer them nothing more than "poverty with dignity," he believes it may at least prevent starvation. Aristide's writing is simple and direct; he capably juggles heartrending anecdotes, unnerving statistics, unflinching commentary and the occasional Bible quote. The result reads at times like a hard-hitting sermon and at times like a campaign speech, resonating with the conviction of one who knows firsthand the desperation about which he writes. Passion overcomes stridency as Aristide insists that "women, children and the poor must be the subjects, not the objects, of history. They must sit at the decision-making tables and fill the halls of power." This courageous critique of the global economy and how it is leaving the poor behind is important and accessible, sure to touch all but the hardest of hearts. Photos.

Mo considers the cost-effective benefits of cohabitation with Sydney.</p><p>The thousands of devoted readers who follow the weekly chronicles of Bechdel's cartoon heroines--Lois, Sparrow, Ginger, Jezanna, and Mo, among others--probably already know that the strips read best in book form, where Bechdel's sly observations of lesbian life in the 1990s can blend with her ongoing narrative into something like a sketchy but provocative novel. <i>Split-Level Dykes</i>, the eighth collection in the series, is no exception. Its two dominant story lines--politically correct Mo commits herself to the brainy and self-absorbed Sydney, while Clarice and Toni, lesbian moms of color, nearly break up over their move to the great white suburbs--keep the reader enthralled and anxious, easy prey to the comic relief of Sparrow's heterosexual panic and the dating foibles of the swashbuckling Lois. With an anthropologist's eye for social detail, Bechdel fleshes out her two-dimensional world into something you could consider either the best kind of beach reading or the stuff of doctoral dissertations. <i>--Regina Marler</i>It's moving day for Bechdel's (Hot, Throbbing Dykes to Watch Out For, etc.) multicultural cast of characters in her latest collection of literate and satirical comic strips. Using breezy jargon, Bechdel redefines race and gender roles while taking aim at some of the pungent topics of the day (the impeachment drama, the restructuring of academe, the "reclamation" of gays via Christian conversion). Her characters are exceedingly bright and ambitious: Sydney is readying a book for publication and her postcoital chatter includes asides about literary deconstruction; recent Ph.D. Ginger mulls over a job offer from Buffalo Lake State U., a no-place that nonetheless attracted 463 applications for a teaching post with little pay and no perks. Much of the book concerns the "demographic rift," which begins when the house that Ginger, Lois and Sparrow occupy as a kind of latter-day commune is offered for sale and the trio decide to buy it themselves. Toni, Clarice and their son, Rafael, are also moving?from their apartment to a suburban house?despite Clarice and Ginger's sudden, lustful preoccupation with their old love affair. The disparate tales are tied together by a moving truck that everyone shares, ratcheting up the hectic atmosphere of the moving-day finale. Funny, irreverent and fearless, Bechdel delivers the thinking woman's funny papers. (Dec.)

The last holdouts against corruption&#x2013;the cops who can&#x2019;t be bought, the D.A.s who can&#x2019;t be intimidated&#x2013;are outnumbered and outgunned. They need help . . . fast. <br><br> A world away, in a dank Himalayan prison, a nameless, hardened man fights every day to survive. He has spent seven years scouring the globe, studying the criminal mind, looking for an answer to the ugly riddle of his childhood. But something has been looking for him, too. Here, in the darkest places of his own anger, Bruce Wayne will discover his destiny&#x2013;and an ordinary man will become a legend.</p><p>For more than twenty years, editor and writer Dennis O&#x2019;Neil put the &#x201c;dark&#x201d; in the Dark Knight and was the guiding force behind the Batman mythos at DC Comics.

It will be folly, and he will fail as the Frenchman before him failed. The war will end soon. Not this year, certainly, nor the next, but soon, and when it does, Hitler will suffer defeat.<br><br>Once, I thought he would be a useful tool. I was mistaken. His hatred is too narrow and narcissistic to accommodate a large vision.<br><br>In the meantime, we have managed to divert the energies of his munitions scientists into fruitless efforts. They will not succeed in making a nuclear bomb in the foreseeable future. In America, by way of contrast, our men in New Mexico report that progress on the Americans&#x2019; atomic weaponry goes well. I will be interested to see against which enemy the Allies will deploy it.<br><br>After the end of hostilities I will initiate a new kind of attack. I will use economics as a weapon and attempt to debilitate the despoilers with their own favorite instrument.<br><br>That is in the future. For the next several years we will remain in Switzerland. The Austrian is not likely to violate this nation&#x2019;s neutrality, which means my retinue and I will remain in these mountains for the duration. We are undisturbed here and the place pleases me. It is clean and pure and when I breathe the chill, bracing air I am reminded of what a paradise the earth once was and will be again, and I am prompted to redouble my efforts.<br><br>Last night, the woman who is my current consort gave birth to a female. I am a methodical man and I keep records. Thus, I know that I have now sired four hundred and fourteen children, all of them except two, female. The two who were male, Hector and Claudius, both died before their first birthdays.<br><br>It is a source of the greatest vexation to me that I have been unable to produce a healthy male child. I am a man of rationality and science. I do not believe in curses. But at times I think I am cursed.<br><br>I must have a son.<br><br>Later, Bruce would come to understand the power of myth: how those ancient stories could deepen and amplify&#x2014;and distort and falsify&#x2014;human experience. It was to be one of many lessons he learned from R�a&#x2019;s al Gh�ul. But that was later. At the moment, though, he slouched in a desk chair in a midwestern classroom, staring out the window and wondering if the bald stick of a professor, who was wearing a tweed jacket even though it was July and this hundred-year-old university could not afford to air-condition its buildings, would ever finish his drone. On and on went the professor, about Jungian archetypes and monomyths and other stuff that Bruce considered absolutely nonessential to any conceivable life he might want to lead, if not plain stupid. Today&#x2019;s topic, the prof had announced in a voice that even he had to know was somniferous, was loss of innocence as exemplified by the biblical Adam and Eve tale and the Buddhist legend of Siddhartha&#x2019;s first exit from his father&#x2019;s estate.<br><br>Ho hum, Bruce thought. He had read the material the prof had assigned and several other books on the subject, too; all of which presented the material more cogently than the prof, and none of which interested him.<br><br>He vowed to himself that he would never, never waste his time in a liberal arts course again. He had signed up for this one as an experiment and the experiment was a colossal bust. He dropped his gaze to the gold Rolex on his wrist. Would this purgatory ever end?<br><br>Twenty minutes later, it had, and Bruce was walking across a quadrangle toward the clock tower in the center of the campus where he had promised to meet the cute girl from his advanced calculus class. He would lend her his notes and she would buy him coffee&#x2014;that was their deal. To his surprise, he found that his mind kept returning to the class he had just finished enduring and specifically to the Siddhartha story. There were several versions: the simplest of them related how a prince, scion of a wealthy Nepalese family, had been sheltered from the harshness of re- ality until one day he had left his father&#x2019;s grounds and encountered a sick man, an old man, and a corpse. These encounters so upset the young prince that he vowed to live a life of denial until he could make sense of them.<br><br>Suddenly Bruce stopped in midstride as he realized, astonished, that he identified with Siddhartha.<br><br>And then he remembered the garden behind his parents&#x2019; mansion. Of course, he did not know it was a &#x201c;mansion,&#x201d; not until years later, after his parents had died. It was just &#x201c;indoors&#x201d; as the garden was &#x201c;outdoors,&#x201d; and they were all he had ever known, apart from Mother, Father, and funny old Alfred. During his fourth birthday party, Mother, Father, and Alfred brought other children into the house, a lot of other children, who yelled and ran around and gave him presents. He knew he was supposed to like them, but he couldn&#x2019;t. Except for one. She was a little taller than Bruce and she wore a yellow dress and white shoes and in her hair, a yellow ribbon. She didn&#x2019;t yell and run like the others. Her name was Rachel and she was nice.<br><br>Rachel, his mother explained, lived in the staff housing near the manor, wherever that was, and Rachel&#x2019;s mother was the Waynes&#x2019; housekeeper. Mother said that if Bruce wanted to play with her, she could come and visit him often. That was okay with Bruce.<br><br>Over the next three years, Bruce had what his mother called &#x201c;play dates&#x201d; with other kids, including some he secretly wished would stay away, but Rachel was the friend he saw the most. Sometimes, they would go to where she lived, which seemed very strange to Bruce, full of different smells and old furniture, but mostly they played at Bruce&#x2019;s. Together, they explored every room and then ventured outside. Once, they asked if they could play in the guesthouse, near the front gate, where Mother and Father sometimes entertained friends over weekends, but Mother thought that was not such a good idea. But they could pretty much go anywhere else on the grounds, as long as they stayed within the high fences.<br><br>The garden, which Bruce had once thought stretched to the ends of the earth, now seemed quite negotiable, and when he and Rachel dared to venture beyond the gate, they discovered that the big, silvery thing they had seen from afar was actually a small building made of glass. Alfred said it was a &#x201c;greenhouse,&#x201d; where his mother and father grew plants. Usually, the greenhouse door was locked but today, this bright warm, breezy day in mid-June, Alfred had left it ajar. Cautiously, hand in hand, Bruce and Rachel entered. Bruce stopped just inside the door, released Rachel&#x2019;s hand, and looked around at rows of tables covered with potted plants and tools he had never seen before. There were more plants hanging from the sloping ceiling and lumpy bags on the floor. Bruce was hot and sweaty and a thick, heavy odor clogged his nostrils. He didn&#x2019;t like this &#x201c;greenhouse&#x201d; at all.<br><br>Rachel had gone ahead of him and was crawling under one of the long tables. She crawled back out and peered up at Bruce, her small hand held over her head and closed around something. Bruce knew that she had found something, some kind of treasure, maybe.<br><br>&#x201c;Can I see?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Finder&#x2019;s keepers,&#x201d; Rachel said, smiling. &#x201c;I found it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In my greenhouse.&#x201d;<br><br>Rachel&#x2019;s smile changed to a frown and for a second or two she seemed to be thinking. She smiled again and opened her hand. A stone arrowhead lay on her palm. Bruce wondered how it had gotten there, under the table, but not for long. He grabbed it, stuffed it into a pocket, and ran out the nearest door to hide.<br><br>Bruce ran onto a small patch of ground enclosed by a low fence. In the center was a low, round well.<br><br>Knowing that Rachel was following him and wanting to impress her&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t know why&#x2014;Bruce climbed up onto the top of the well. The hole inside was covered with green-painted boards that had splinters of yellow showing: old boards. Slowly, Bruce climbed on top of the wood.<br><br>Then he heard a creaking sound and the world seemed to tilt and the stone wall of the well was rushing past his eyes.<br><br>He just had time to realize he was falling before he stopped so suddenly that his teeth clicked and for a moment he could not breathe. Then he gasped and filled his lungs with air. From somewhere above him, he heard Rachel screaming: &#x201c;Mister Alfred!&#x201d;<br><br>He looked up and saw the opening of the well, a circle of light far, far above. Glancing back down, he saw that he had landed on a pile of dirt and rubble. He put his palms on the cold stone wall and slowly, wondering if he had broken anything, he stood. He was trembling and aware of a nasty scrape on one knee, but his body felt basically all right.<br><br>I can really show Rachel how brave I am, he thought. I can find a way out of here and&#x2014;<br><br>He heard a sound like a door with very rusty hinges being opened. It seemed to be coming from a gap in the stones. He put his face to the black opening, hoping to see the source of the sound&#x2014;<br><br>Something stiff and scratchy rasped across his forehead and in an instant he realized&#x2014;he did not know how&#x2014;that the thing was alive.<br><br>The thing, the dark, horrible thing, flew from the gap and spiraled upward and was followed by other things, a swarm of them, hundreds of them, flapping and screeching, tearing at Bruce&#x2019;s clothing and hair. Bats, he realized, and Bruce felt himself, his personality, his very being, shrink and vanish and only a voice that shrieked and shrieked remained . . .<br><br>Then the bats were gone. The shrieking stopped. Bruce lay atop the dirt, gasping and sobbing.<br><br>He heard someone call his name, and when he looked up, he saw his father, wearing a long black coat, climbing down a rope.<br><br>Strong arms enveloped him and he felt himself being lifted, and raised, and then his father was carrying him past the greenhouse, toward the mansion, with Alfred trotting alongside. Rachel walked next to them, crying. Her mother put her arms around Rachel to comfort her.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?&#x201d; Alfred asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We have everything we need,&#x201d; Bruce&#x2019;s father replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take X-rays later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very good, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Smiling, Bruce held his hand out to Rachel. When she moved next to him, he gently placed the arrowhead in her open palm. Looking up at Bruce, a small smile appeared on Rachel&#x2019;s tearstained face.<br><br>A few minutes later Bruce was in the room his father called &#x201c;the office,&#x201d; being cradled in Mother&#x2019;s soft arms while Father, his sleeves rolled up and his tie loosened, examined Bruce&#x2019;s scrapes and bruises. Bruce was still crying, but only a little.<br><br>&#x201c;There, there,&#x201d; Mother cooed. &#x201c;Everything is all right, Bruce. Everything is fine. Nothing like that will ever happen to you again, I promise.&#x201d;<br><br>Father finished his ministrations and Mother led Bruce up to his room.<br><br>The next morning he awoke to see his father standing over him.<br><br>&#x201c;You were getting kind of noisy in your sleep,&#x201d; Father said. &#x201c;Bad dream?&#x201d;<br><br>Bruce nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;The bats?&#x201d; Father sat on the side of the bed. &#x201c;You know why they attacked you? They were afraid of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Afraid of me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a lot bigger than a bat, aren&#x2019;t you? All creatures feel fear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even the scary ones?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially the scary ones.&#x201d;<br><br>Standing under the clock tower on the midwestern campus, waiting for the cute girl from advanced calculus, Bruce understood his identification with Siddhartha. Falling down the well, Bruce had, like Siddhartha, passed through a gate, albeit a metaphorical one. Before his tumble, he had heard the word &#x201c;fear&#x201d; and similar words like &#x201c;scared&#x201d; and &#x201c;afraid&#x201d; and &#x201c;dread&#x201d; . . . but they were only words. Afterward, despite his mother&#x2019;s comforting and his father&#x2019;s deft attentions, Bruce knew, to the marrow of his being, what &#x201c;fear&#x201d; was. Within a week, he was to add &#x201c;hate&#x201d; and &#x201c;grief&#x201d; to his lexicon.<br><br>From the Journals of R�a&#x2019;s al Gh�ul<br><br>My daughter, who is uncommonly mature for her age, last night told me that I am a &#x201c;self-appointed messiah.&#x201d; She meant it as an affront.

The book includes an expert guide to nine fundamental textile techniques, from rug weaving and tapestry to felt and bark cloth. Each is clearly explained, using line drawings and close-up color details from actual textiles, to show how people from many different traditions have made and decorated cloth through the centuries. The breathtaking wealth of illustrations drawn from major collections all over the world includes costumes, period interiors, archival photographs, and a vast range of fabrics, from the simplest handwoven cloths to sumptuous brocades and exquisite embroidery.</p><p><b>Jennifer Harris</b> is Deputy Director and Curator of Textiles at Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester.

The first in King&#39;s epic Dark Tower series.</p><p>Thirty-three years, a horrific and life-altering accident, and thousands of desperately rabid fans in the making, Stephen King's quest to complete his magnum opus rivals the quest of Roland and his band of gunslingers who inhabit the Dark Tower series. Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono.

From Benefit Street, the Mile of History, to the statue of the Independent Man, follow Mack Woodward on 12 walking and driving tours of the Renaissance city. Written by architectural historian Wm McKenzie Woodward and photographed by renowned architectural photographer Warren Jagger, this 320-page guide features 12 different self-guided tours of the city and includes maps, photographs and historical commentary as well as descriptions of more than 300 buildings and streetscapes. &#34;Mack Woodward succeeded the late [architectural historian] William Jordy in the vitally important role of person-who-knows-more-about-Providence-architecture-than-anyone. He shares his knowledge with resident and architectural tourist alike and makes Providence&#34;s treasures readable and accessible. It answers questions about the buildings we have passed and admired, but about which we knew little. In learning what makes our city unique, recalling what we have lost, and imagining what we might lose, the real value of the Guide is that it reminds us of our responsibility to the future of Providence&#39;s past.&#34; - From the foreword by William Morgan</p><p></p><h2>Grenada: An Eyewitness Account of the U.S. Invasion and the Caribbean History That Provoked It</h2><p>One of the only two foreign journalists present in Grenada for the U.S. invasion provides a firsthand account of the invasion and the immediate events and history leading up to it</p><p></p><h2>Seventh-day Adventists Believe...A Biblical Exposition of 27 Fundamental Doctrines</h2><p>The 27 basic beliefs shared by Seventh-day Adventists are here at your fingertips, ready to be explored, appraised, and substantiated.

His reporting from Sarajevo won him a George Polk Award for excellence in radio reporting. He is the author of <i>Sarajevo Daily: A City and Its Newspaper Under Siege.</i>The commonplace view of Cuba's prerevolutionary business establishment as a corrupt kleptocracy is revised in this intriguing history of the Bacardi rum company and its involvement in Cuban politics. NPR correspondent Gjelten (<i>Sarajevo Daily</i>) paints the 146-year-old distiller, once an icon of Cuban industry, as a model corporate citizen&#x2014;efficient, innovative, socially responsible and union-tolerant. Its leaders were pillars of nationalist politics, he contends: company president Emilio Bacardi was a leader of Cuba's rebellion against Spain, and in the 1950s CEO Jos� Bosch helped fund Castro's insurrection. (After Castro nationalized Bacardi's Cuban holdings, Bosch started funding anti-Castro exiles.) Bacardi's image as Cuban-nationalism-in-a-bottle becomes farcical when the company, now a multinational behemoth, fights an absurd court battle with Cuba's state rum company over the Havana Club trademark. But Gjelten's account of a liberal, progressive Cuban business clan complicates and enriches the conventional picture of a society torn between right and left dictatorships. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You think you know it as that which you can touch and feel, the world you plant your feet on and that feeds you. You think it's really solid stuff. </p><p>The "Real" World </p><p>You're wrong! The "Real" World isn't really solid stuff, and the Mystical is actually the very stuff of reality - the far bigger reality that is as modern as tomorrow, and as practical as money in the bank. The Mystical is about actually understanding how things really work and how you can benefit from personal exploration and experience in what some people refer to as "the Magical Universe" where truly real things happen and affect you in this world you thought was such a solid thing. </p><p>This Magical Universe where real things happen is the same universe studied by modern scientists at the cutting edge of quantum physics and consciousness, and that has been studied for ages by mystics, philosophers, Kabbalists, shamans, hermeticists, yogis, alchemists - all scientists exploring those dimensions lying behind, below, inside, and above what you once thought of as the only "real" world. </p><p>Using Esoteric Technology </p><p>It is be means of various 'esoteric' technologies that you can actually reach in - behind the scenes so to speak - to touch, work with or even change the inner reality that manifests in the outer world. These technologies have been developed out of many differing perceptions of the inner reality that are as equally true and valid as are the many ways to describe the glory of a sunset, the beauty of a rose, or the glow of love. </p><p>Scientists and Mystics have developed many models to understand, explore and relate to this hidden world, each as different and yet the same as the brilliant facets on a cut diamond. These have names and their validity is enhanced by their attraction to you and the beauty you find in them.

His first novel, <i>A Beautiful Blue Death,</i> was named one of Library Journal&#x2019;s Best Books of 2007, one of only five mystery novels on the list. He lives in New York.</p>PROLOGUE <p></p>The first murders were committed nineteen years before the second, on a dry and unremarkable day along the Sutlej Frontier in Punjab. <p></p>It was beastly hot weather, as Juniper remarked to Captain Lysander out on the veranda of the officers&#x2019; mess, fit for little more than an odd gin and tonic, perhaps the lazy composition of a letter home. The flies, maddening creatures that had never learned to take no for an answer, crowded around the nets that blocked the porch, searching for a way in. "I would trade a hand to be back in London," Lysander said to Juniper after a long pause. "At least they have the decency to bar these flies from coming into the city there." <p></p>The battalion was on edge, because a recent retaliatory raid on a local village had turned bloody. Suspicion and rumor abounded. The officers, with a few exceptions, had long ceased to attend to their charges&#x2019; morale. Though all the Englishmen in Punjab lived well, with villas and servants to themselves, every one of them at that uneasy moment would have made the trade Lysander proposed. <p></p>"Well," said Juniper. "I may go look around and have a bit of a shoot with Jim." <p></p>"Were you planning that?" <p></p>"Oh, yes." <p></p>"Where do you reckon you&#x2019;ll go?" <p></p>"That little patch of scrub east of here. Doubt we&#x2019;ll find anything worth a bullet. Maybe a darkie or two, looking for trouble." <p></p>Lysander smiled grimly. "Past that little grove of banyan trees, then?" <p></p>"Curious today, aren&#x2019;t you?" <p></p>In another place this might have sounded rude, but being white was a great equalizer in that country, and these men were too intimate to maintain entirely the ceremonies of respect and rank that defined the British. <p></p>"Always on the lookout for a decent bit of shooting, you know," responded Lysander, sipping his gin and tonic. He was a trim, forceful, savvy-looking man. "D&#x2019;you know why they give us so much tonic, young pup?" <p></p>"No. Why?" <p></p>"Has quinine in it. Prevents malaria." <p></p>"I suppose I did know that, actually." <p></p>"They must&#x2019;ve told you in training." <p></p>"Yes," said Juniper, nodding agreeably. <p></p>"Just past that grove of banyan trees, then?" There was a slight, casual persistence in Lysander&#x2019;s voice. "Ever shot anything edible there?" <p></p>"Not to speak of. There are a few birds, not much on the ground. It&#x2019;s poor sport." <p></p>"So&#x2019;s this whole country." <p></p>"Any more inspirational speech before I leave?" <p></p>"On your way." <p></p>Juniper stood up. "I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll see you for cocktails." <p></p>But he wouldn&#x2019;t, and the other man knew it. <p></p>When Juniper had gone out of sight, Lysander leapt out of his chair and walked briskly up a small dirt path that led from the mess to his villa. The captain&#x2019;s batman, his assistant and a lance corporal, was on the porch, whittling an Indian charm to send back to his mother. He had been working on it for weeks. <p></p>"Best go do it now," Lysander said. "He&#x2019;s off with Juniper. Both of them, would you? They&#x2019;re hunting, out east, in that scrub." <p></p>"Yes, sir," said the batman, standing. Here rank still meant something. <p></p>"Do your best to make it look like an accident, obviously." <p></p>"Yes, sir." <p></p>Lysander paused. "By the way, that treasure?" <p></p>"Yes, sir?" <p></p>"There&#x2019;s talk of a society. Don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s to be called yet, and it will be for officers alone." <p></p>"Sir?" <p></p>"But if you do right by us, we&#x2019;ll do right by you." <p></p>"Thank you, sir." <p></p>The batman ran off, and Lysander called to one of the servants, a fair Indian lad, swathed in brilliant pink and pale blue that contrasted with the dull beige of the landscape and the military man&#x2019;s uniform. The boy with some sullenness came forward. <p></p>"That box," Lysander barked. "Bring it to me. And it&#x2019;s worth your life to open it before it gets here." <p></p>A moment later he was holding the box, and, when certain he was alone, he opened it to reveal a massive, pristine, and beautiful sapphire. <p></p>As he snapped the box shut and had it taken away, Juniper and his friend Jim emerged from the latter&#x2019;s house, guns broken over their arms, both wearing beige, broad-brimmed hats to keep the dying sun off of their necks and faces. They had a bantering style of conversation that sounded as if it had been picked up from a thousand other conversations before. It was clear how much closer they were than Juniper and Lysander. <p></p>"A farthing says you&#x2019;ll never eat what you shoot," Juniper said with a laugh. <p></p>"A farthing? I&#x2019;ve played higher stakes than that with women." <p></p>"That serving girl of mine you like, then." <p></p>"What do I have to eat?" <p></p>"First thing either of us shoots." <p></p>"What if it&#x2019;s the dirt?" <p></p>"Bet&#x2019;s a bet." <p></p>"How much dirt would I have to eat?" <p></p>"Nice haunch of it." <p></p>"Farthing for the first meat, let&#x2019;s go back to that. Don&#x2019;t shoot anything too horrible." <p></p>"I&#x2019;m insulted you&#x2019;d suggest it." <p></p>It was a little more than a mile outside of camp, away from Lahore&#x2014;and that city&#x2019;s dangers, which these two men knew all too well&#x2014;that they found a decent patch of land. It had a few bushes and trees scattered around it. They didn&#x2019;t have a dog, but Juniper shot into the undergrowth and drove a few birds out into the open, where the two men had a clear look at them. <p></p>They observed the birds fluttering, partially obscured, soon to be dead. Ruminatively, Juniper said, "What do you miss most? About England?" <p></p>His interlocutor thought it over. "I wish I hadn&#x2019;t left it so badly with my family, you know. I miss them." <p></p>"I do, too." <p></p>"Only six months, I suppose." <p></p>Then both men heard a scratching emerge from the under-growth that lay off to their side. <p></p>A shot. The fall of a body. Another shot. The fall of a body. A lone figure, Lysander&#x2019;s batman, rose from his hidden spot and ran off full bore back west. And then a long, long silence, in the empty land that stretched blank as far as the eye could see, in every direction, forty-five hundred miles away from Piccadilly Circus. <p></p>Excerpted from The September Society by Charles Finch <p></p>Copyright � 2008 by Charles Finch <p></p>Published in 2008 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Minotaur <p></p>All rights reserved.

A Christy Award winner, Robin is a popular speaker, both at home and abroad, and is frequently interviewed on radio and television.After booking my ticket to the Netherlands, I sat quietly in front of the computer, contemplating what to do next.<br>Outside the rain carried out its spring fling with gusto. Telling my husband seemed wise. Not on the phone,though. I didn&#x2019;t want to say the words &#x201c;abnormal mammogram,&#x201d; &#x201c;biopsy,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving for a week&#x201d; unless I could see his face.<br>So I decided to bake cookies. After padding my way to the kitchen, I pulled out a mixing bowl and turned the oven to 375 degrees.<br>I&#x2019;m not the sort of woman who takes a long bath or a long walk to have time and space to think. For me, the best processing happens when I have my well-used mixing bowl balanced on my hip. No electric mixers for me. I beat the lumps out of my life challenges with a wooden spoon.<br>Then I line up all the solutions in my head while arranging the lumpy balls of dough on the cookie sheet. Soon the scent of all that lovely butter, brown sugar, and oatmeal wafts from the kitchen, and I start to feel better.<br>The fragrance fills the house with a standing invitation for my children to &#x201c;come hither.&#x201d; As they gather around the kitchen counter, I remember what really matters, and my problem is somehow quietly resolved.<br>Only this time I knew that when the enticing fragrance raced down the hall into each bedroom, it would find no takers. All our children were launched and flitting about in their own worlds.<br><i>Abnormal. Biopsy.<br></i>I went after the cookie dough with renewed mixing vigor. Taking a few steps closer to the refrigerator, I looked over the collection of off-kilter photos until I found the one of Noelle standing in a field of tulips with a windmill in the background.<br><i>You&#x2019;re going there, Summer. It&#x2019;s going to happen. You&#x2019;re going to see Noelle. You really are. Believe it.<br></i>For many years a variety of photos and postcards have adorned our refrigerator. Every time I would stop mid&#x2013;pot roast extraction or post&#x2013;milk replenishment, the images I would look for were the ones of Noelle and her world.<br>How long had I dreamed of seeing those tilt-a-wheel windmills and picking those bursting-with-color tulips by the armful?<br>As I dropped the dough into agreeable rows and slid the cookie sheets into the oven, I made another decision. I would tell Wayne everything as soon as he came home. But I wouldn&#x2019;t tell anyone else about the biopsy until I had received the results. Not even Noelle.<br>If everything worked out for me to see Noelle, I wanted to spend my time with her as unencumbered as possible. I would take the trip in a self-induced state of denial. Yes, complete denial. It was the only way I would be able to enjoy the visit.<br>I foraged around in the garage for a suitcase and went hunting through Wayne&#x2019;s desk for my passport. The scent of warm cookies encircled me, and I thought about how one should never underestimate the power of comfort food when faced with monumental decisions. I&#x2019;m convinced that the fragrance of cinnamon and sugar enlivens the heart and strengthens the senses when a woman is in want of a special measure of courage.<br>My courage lasted all afternoon and kept me company as I ran errands. Denial can be a wonderful thing.Why had I never called upon its fabulous powers before?<br>I was eager to reach home to see if Noelle had read my e-mail yet. In the rhythmof our online correspondence, I would write to her toward the close ofmy day, and she would read my post at the start of her new day.The time difference between our two lives was six hours. She was always six hours ahead of me. Maybe she had seen my e-mail before going to bed. Maybe she already had responded.<br>The rain stopped as I rounded the corner, returning home with a full tank of gas and a week&#x2019;s worth of groceries. Wayne&#x2019;s car was in the garage when I pulled in. I inched the old family minivan up to the hanging tennis ball to make sure the van was in far enough to close the garage door. As the tennis ball did its usual bounce-bounce against the windshield, anxiety surged in my stomach. Everything in me tightened. I sat in the car, waiting for the cinnamon-laced courage to come back.<br>I wasn&#x2019;t afraid of what Wayne would say. He is a great husband. I didn&#x2019;t always think that, but I do now. The longer we&#x2019;ve been married, the better our relationship has become. The anxiety was connected to my logic in all this. How wise was it for me to leave the country right now?What would be the repercussions of staying in denial for another week or so?<br>Wayne stepped out into the garage.He peered at me through the windshield with a half-eaten cookie in his hand.<br><br> &#x201c;You coming in?&#x201d;<br>I nodded but didn&#x2019;t move.<br>&#x201c;Summer?&#x201d;<br>I couldn&#x2019;t quite get my body to open the door and exit the car.<br>&#x201c;Honey, are you okay?&#x201d; Wayne came over to the passenger side.He opened the door and climbed in.His current position at our church as one of the associate pastors includes most of the counseling load. Wayne is a careful listener. He is intuitive and empathetic in his approach, which was quite an adjustment from the &#x201c;Wild Wayne&#x201d; I had married when I was nineteen years old. Life, love, loss, and raising six children had had a marinating effect on his heart. He is a big softy now.<br>&#x201c;Is it one of the kids?&#x201d;Wayne reached over and wove his fingers through my nearly shoulder-length brown hair.With a steady hand hemassaged the back ofmy neck. &#x201c;What is it?What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br>I let out a long sigh and then exhaled all the details, starting with the phone call and rolling right into how I had put a flight to Amsterdamon hold and had e-mailed Noelle, asking if I could come see her for a week.<br>Then I sat very still, my hands clutching the lower rim of the steering wheel, waiting for his response, which I knew could go either way. The neighbor&#x2019;s schnauzer barked. The car&#x2019;s engine pinged. Wayne untangled his fingers from my hair and said the last thing I expected. &#x201c;Good for you.&#x201d;<br>I turned to take in his full expression. &#x201c;Does that mean you think I should do this? I should go to the Netherlands?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Summer, for as long as I&#x2019;ve known you, you&#x2019;ve talked about meeting Noelle. Yes, I think you should do this, and, yes, I think now is the time to go. The biopsy can wait another week or so, can&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;<br>Wayne took my hand in his. &#x201c;Do you remember what you told the kids when they left the house?&#x201d;<br>I nodded. My farewell line was the same for each of them, and after saying it six times, I was quite familiar with the utterance. I just hadn&#x2019;t realized that Wayne had heard me say it. Or had remembered it.<br>&#x201c;You told the kids, &#x2018;Go make your own adventures, and come home often to tell us about them.&#x2019;&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s time for you to do the same. Go make your own adventure, honey. When you come home, I&#x2019;ll want to hear all about it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Myth-Gotten Gains (Myth Adventures)</h2><p>Someone is collecting animated treasures and keeping them from their heroic destinies.

Like Diane Shaw's Almost Vegetarian (LJ 9/15/94), Lee's book is directed to those who haven't necessarily given up meat but who are no longer eating it every day; although stricter vegetarians will certainly enjoy her recipes, many include suggestions for nonvegetarian variations or accompaniments. An attractive collection from an enthusiastic and accomplished cook, this is highly recommended.

I have always thought that if an author cannot make friends with the reader and explain his objects in two or three hundred pages he is not likely to do so in fifty lines.

Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 &#34;for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values&#34;.</p><h2>World Rushed In</h2><p>The World Rushed In is a pioneering achievement in historical writing, at once a personal, intimate story of one man&#39;s search for wealth and the definitive account of the California gold rush. Building upon the copious journals of gold seeker William Swain and enlarging upon his experiences through the imaginative interweaving of his diaries with the letters of hundreds of other &#39;49ers, J. S. Holliday gives the reader a compelling opportunity to be part of one of America&#39;s most exciting and important adventures. Holliday captures the triumphs and tragedies of Swain and his compatriots in vivid, human terms, from the dangerous journey across the plains and mountains to the rugged mining camps of northern California. This is history at its very best.</p><p><p> <b>CHAPTER I</b> </p><p> A Migration of Strangers </p><p> <i>"Great talk about California gold region and I don't know hardly what to think of it. I have at times a mind to go...."</i> </p><p> In midsummer 1848 city and small-town newspapers in the United States told of political debate in Washington over a plan to prohibit the expansion of slavery into the West and specifically into the territories recently conquered from Mexico. Fearful of angering voters on both sides of the controversy, the candidates in the upcoming presidential election, Democrat Lewis Cass and Whig General Zachary Taylor, hero of the war with Mexico, avoided making any statements on the subject. </p><p> In early August a more interesting story began to appear. A St. Louis newspaper on the 8th printed part of an article brought overland from San Francisco, where it had appeared in the April 1 issue of the <i>California Star.</i> The news told of gold "collected at random and without any trouble" on the American River. A letter from California in the New York <i>Herald,</i> August 19, predicted "a Peruvian harvest of precious metals." Other major newspapers -- the Baltimore <i>Sun,</i> the New Orleans <i>Daily Picayune</i> -- printed similarly colorful letters and reports from "the gold regions." Editors across the country impatiently sought whatever news of California could be found. The New York <i>Journal of Commerce</i> ran a letter from the alcalde of Monterey which told of miners digging "eight to ten ounces a day." He concluded by characterizing the miners as "men who open a vein of gold just as coolly as you would a potato hill." On September 14 the Philadelphia <i>North American</i> printed another letter from the exuberant alcalde in which he boasted, "Your streams have minnows and ours are paved with gold." </p><p> Across the country Americans read and talked of gold and felt increasingly envious of miners who could dig their fortunes in a matter of days or weeks. For farmers in Massachusetts or Kentucky and city folk in Cincinnati or Savannah discouraged by their prospects, for others restless after returning home from the war with Mexico, or those weary of marriage or fearful of growing debts, these first reports of gold and the resulting expectations of quick fortune might have been enough to send them on their way to El Dorado. But for most potential goldseekers in the thirty states, far more tangible evidence was needed to overcome doubts and scoffing neighbors -- evidence strong enough to justify to wives and creditors, parents and business partners the expense and the danger of the long journey to California. </p><p> What the American people needed was an official endorsement of the California news. It came in December, directly from the two most trusted authorities in the nation: the President and the United States Army. </p><p> Having received Colonel Mason's official report of the diggings, President James K. Polk was prepared to speak with authority and confidence about the astonishing events in California. Mason had sent dramatic evidence (the 230 ounces of gold) to back up his report, and he set forth his judgment of California: "I have no hesitation in saying there is more gold in the country drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers than will pay the cost of the war with Mexico a hundred times over." Thus encouraged and more than willing to find additional justification for the recent war of conquest with Mexico, President Polk on December 5, 1848, delivered his message to the second session of the 30th Congress. Of the news from California, he stated: "The accounts of the abundance of gold in that territory are of such extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief were they not corroborated by authentic reports of officers in the public service." With this endorsement of the seemingly incredible, with the gold on display at the War Department, and with the full details of Mason's report published throughout the nation, skepticism gave way to unrestrained enthusiasm. </p><p> After December 5 and through the winter and spring of 1849, there appeared in literally every newspaper in the country continuing reports of the ever-increasing emigration to California. Whether in New York or Iowa, editors wrote of the national drama in florid phrases and excited tones, as if the wonder and impact of the news might not otherwise be fully appreciated. </p><p> On January 11, 1849, the New York <i>Herald</i> trumpeted its judgment: "The spirit of emigration which is carrying off thousands to California so far from dying away increases and expands every day. All classes of our citizens seem to be under the influence of this extraordinary mania....If the government were under the necessity of making a levy of volunteers to the amount of two or three hundred thousand men for any purpose in California, the ranks would be filled in less than three months....What will this general and overwhelming spirit of emigration lead to? Will it be the beginning of a new empire in the West, a revolution in the commercial highways of the world, a depopulation of the old States for the new republic on the shores of the Pacific? </p><p> "Look at the advertising columns of the <i>Herald</i> or any other journal, and you will find abundant evidence of the singular prevalence of this strange movement and agitation in favor of gold digging on the Sacramento. Every day men of property and means are advertising their possessions for sale, in order to furnish them with means to reach that golden land. Every city and town is forming societies either to cross the Isthmus or to double Cape Horn.... </p><p> "Poets, philosophers, lawyers, brokers, bankers, merchants, farmers, clergymen -- all are feeling the impulse and are preparing to go and dig for gold and swell the number of adventurers to the new El Dorado. </p><p> "The spirit which has been thus awakened in this country by the discovery of the gold mines in California and by the authentic facts published concerning them under the authority of the government in Washington exceeds everything in the history of commercial adventure that has occurred in many ages and can only be paralleled by that which sprang up in Spain and other parts of Europe by the discovery of the mineral wealth of Mexico and Peru by the expeditions of Cortez and Pizarro." </p><p> More influential than such editorial fervor, what nurtured hopes on farms and in villages and challenged the faint-hearted were personal reports direct from California -- letters sent home by settlers who had become California's first gold miners. Eagerly sought by local newspapers and then reprinted again and again by dailies and weeklies in other states, these statements written in the language of neighbors told of digging for gold along rivers called the American, Feather, Yuba and Mokelumne, where in a matter of months young men using methods that sounded simple, even haphazard, gathered fortunes totaling thousands, tens of thousands of dollars. </p><p> A letter from a man named McClellan written to his family in Jackson, Missouri, concluded: "You know Bryant, the carpenter who used to work for Ebenezer Dixon, well, he has dug more gold in the last six months than a mule can pack." In family councils at day's end, in churchyards after the Sunday sermon, in country stores and city saloons, men used Bryant's triumph or similar reports to argue in favor of going to California. Week by week the news gathered force, more men believed and their families agreed that if they could get to California success would be assured, success that required no knowledge of mining and only a few months' work. </p><p> As the frugality of generations gave way to a contagion of optimism and ambition, responsible family men found their jobs and prospects unrewarding when set against all that California could provide. They figured how much they could bring home after a year's sojourn in the gold fields and justified the cost of the journey and the length of their absence as an investment that would guarantee financial security. And it was not just ambitious men who dreamed. In January 1849 the wife of a struggling shopkeeper wrote to her parents: "Joseph has borrowed the money to go; but I am full of bright visions that never filled my mind before, because at the best of times I have never thought of much beyond a living; but now I feel confident of being well off." </p><p> In East Coast ports, shipowners announced sailing dates for steamers, schooners, brigs and old whaling ships resurrected to meet the sudden demand. Newspaper advertising columns announced the sale of businesses by men "overtaken by the gold fever." Manufacturers of money belts, tents, India-rubber wading boots and clothing, medicines, and gold testing and smelting devices proclaimed their products essential to success in the land of gold. And inventors attested to the infallibility of their patented mining machinery, including a "hydro-centrifugal Chrysolyte or California Gold Finder" and an "Archimedes Gold Washing Machine." Equally imaginative entrepreneurs announced an "aerial locomotive" capable of carrying fifty to one hundred passengers from New York to California "pleasantly and safely" in three days at a cost of $200 -- and they assured their readers that two hundred tickets had already been sold. </p><p> Those more aware of the realities of geography and commerce knew that the journey would require many weeks -- even months -- of arduous, possibly dangerous travel by wilderness trails or ocean voyages. For those on the Atlantic Coast with seafaring traditions, the ocean routes seemed the only way to go. For forty years New England merchants and whalers had sent their ships around Cape Horn, an 18,000-mile voyage, to the coves and harbors of California, there to trade or obtain fresh food and water. This commercial tradition helped build confidence in the Cape route (despite the distance and four to six months on shipboard), so much so that all but twenty-two of the 124 gold-rush companies that organized in Massachusetts during 1849 sailed around the Horn, taking a total of 6,067 emigrants from that state alone. </p><p> In contrast to the time that would be spent on board a ship sailing around South America, goldseekers could reach California in a matter of weeks by taking a steamer from New York to the town of Chagres on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama. From there it took two or three days through dense jungle to reach the ancient Pacific port of Panama City, where another line of steamers tried to accommodate the ever-pressing demand for passage to San Francisco. If they sailed from New York to Panama in January, February or even March, they could be in the diggings before the first overland emigrants even set out from the western frontier. In all, about 6,500 emigrants took the Panama route in 1849; but disease, exorbitant costs, overcrowding and too few steamers on the Pacific route caused delays of weeks and sometimes months throughout that first year of the rush. </p><p> For those who lived inland and had farming as a background, the ocean voyage seemed fearful, the overland trails practical, even familiar. The well-known history of travel from the Missouri frontier to Santa Fe and to Oregon increased their confidence. During the winter and early spring of 1849 tens of thousands of men throughout the United States prepared for the overland trek that would begin with the first good weather in April or May. In cities and country villages they organized joint-stock companies, each member paying an equal amount to provide funds for the company's purchase of wagons, teams and provisions. Organized as the Pittsburgh and California Enterprise Company, the Illinois and California Mining Company, the Sagamore and Sacramento Mining and Trading Company and many more, goldseekers joined together more as ambitious businessmen than as carefree adventurers. In Ithaca, New York, a company of fifty men, with a capital of $25,000 and a credit of $25,000 more at a local bank, planned to leave the western frontier in early April and reach the gold country in June. There, as the Ithaca <i>Journal</i> reported on March 21, 1849, "they will select a suitable location, erect cabins and proceed to rake in the dust." </p><p> In addition to reporting the financial arrangements of the overland companies, the local newspapers often printed each company's membership lists and their lengthy constitutions, or "Rules of Regulation," which more often than not prohibited swearing, drinking and violation of the Sabbath. Some companies issued uniforms, elected officers with military titles and drilled their members. Some purchased ships which carried cargoes of supplies and trade goods around Cape Horn to San Francisco, there to await the members' arrival by overland trail. One company included in its equipage eleven "gold finders" and a machine for making gold coins. </p><p> To raise money to join an overland company or to purchase a wagon, team and other "California fixings," goldseekers mortgaged or sold homes and farms, took out life savings, or borrowed from friends and fathers-in-law. The financial impact of this money raising caused concern in several states, with editors lamenting the loss of capital withdrawn from the local economy to support the sudden needs of men afflicted with gold fever. On March 27 a newspaper in Ann Arbor, Michigan, estimated that $30,000 had been taken out of Washtenaw County alone, with each man spending an average of $400 to pay for his outfit and transportation to the frontier. Many had to find additional money to provide for their wives and children until their return. A man in Ann Arbor, father of six daughters, sold his home to his brother for $1,200; a farmer on February 24, 1849, sold his acreage to his father-in-law for $1,300. More often, such funds came from mortgages, but some would-be goldseekers found that a mortgage was not always enough -- they had to enter into a contract to share equally with the moneylender the gold that would be found in California. Such contracts suggest the contagion of optimism that spring of 1849. </p><p> Ignorant of guns and camping life except for what they had heard or read in legend and literature, thousands of city and rural men studied John C. Fr�mont's famous <i>Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842 and to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-'44</i> and the accounts of other western travelers. In part motivated by such reading and by the traditional fear of Indians, these emigrants purchased a remarkable number of guns, an impulse encouraged by the U.S. War Department's February 1849 offer to sell pistols, rifles and ammunition at cost to California (and Oregon) emigrants. </p><p> In further preparation for their long journey, they probably bought one of the several "emigrant guides" issued that spring to tell the greenhorns how to find their way through the vastness of mountains and deserts. These publications, along with newspaper articles describing "Travel in the Far West," gave the goldseekers advice on what equipment and food they should purchase, whether oxen or mules made the best teams, where the Indians would be most dangerous. There were even tables of distances which set down the specific mileages from point to point -- water sources, river crossings, major topographic...</p>Howard Lamar Professor of History, Yale University A total, personal, vicarious experience...touching and powerful. -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>The Church Librarian&#39;s Handbook: A Complete Guide for the Library and Resource Center in Christian Education</h2><p>the church Librarian&#39;s handbook : A Complete Guide for the library and Resource center in Christian Education Betty McMichael</p><p></p><h2>Fine Machine Sewing Revised Edition: Easy Ways to Get the Look of Hand Finishing and Embellishing</h2><p>This beautiful reference book makes advanced finishing styles accessible to all levels of sewers.

The African American dancer, brought up in small-town, segregated Texas, was born to poverty. In his autobiography, he remembers "branches slashing against [his] child's body that is glued to his mother's body as they walk through the mud in bare feet, going from one place to another." Ailey reveals the feelings of inferiority that plagued him throughout his life, from his brief but promising sortie as an actor to his ultimate success in the dance world. He also tells of his single, disappointing conversation with his father, Alvin Ailey Sr.; his mother's rape; his own mental breakdown in 1980, precipitated by the death of his friend and colleague Joyce Trisler; and his descent into drug dependency, leading to his hospitalization. Important people in his life discussed here include Carmen de Lavallade, Maya Angelou and Lester Horton. Ailey's homosexuality is handled with reserve.

Photos not seen by PW. </i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.<i>Revelations</i>, one of Ailey's most famous ballets, is the title he selected for his autobiography, which was richly told to his chosen coauthor, Peter A. Bailey. Bailey did not complete the manuscript until after Alvin Ailey's death in 1989. To that core manuscript, he added interviews with dancers, colleagues, and friends who remembered Ailey and his contribution to the world of dance. Ailey reveals for the first time intimate details of his professional hurdles, personal life, and relationships with family and significant others that influenced his life. He discusses politics and racism and their effect on his dancing, on Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and on his self-image. The chapters chronicle his life from his childhood days in Texas to his tours abroad to his Broadway productions in New York to his period of manic depression in 1980. Ailey's life was a series of triumphs and disappointments, yet he managed to overcome his insecurities to become a pioneer in the world of dance and a choreographer of international reputation. For those who are familiar with his life and for those who know little, <i>Revelations</i> is a biographical source well worth reading. <i>Lillian Lewis</i></p><h2>Don&#39;t Step In The Leadership: A Dilbert Book</h2><p>"For the armies of American office workers, <i>Dilbert</i> is a reminder that they are not alone." &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br> "Cruel and incompetent bosses, plus the pervasive stupidity of people Adams calls 'in-duh-viduals,' are favorite targets in the strip, which appears...on the Internet, in best-selling books, and on refrigerator magnets, coffee mugs, desk calendars, software, neckties, and even underwear." &#x2014;<i>Playboy</i> magazine<br><br> Does <i>Dilbert</i> creator Scott Adams have a hidden camera in your office&#x2014;or is he just completely in tune with the inept managers, wacky office politics, and nonsensical leadership practices that seem to run wild at your company?<br><br> Stop looking for the camera. <i>Dilbert</i> has become a hugely successful strip because Adams feels your pain. How? Because this former employee of a major telecommunications company has been there. He's seen the leadership firsthand. And he knows that to successfully navigate the ludicrous world of business, you can't expect common sense to prevail, you need to keep a sense of humor, and above all, you must always look before you leap.<br><br> The strip's enormous popularity stems from the fact that its millions of readers easily identify with the crazy plots and wacky characters found within the corporate environment of collections like this one, <i>Don't Step on the Leadership</i>. Sure, most companies don't have a bespectacled engineer with a tie permanently curled up, a cynical talking dog, and a manager with two pointy tufts of hair. But it's the outrageous things <i>Dilbert</i> characters do and say that leave readers knowingly nodding their heads and, of course, laughing uproariously. The antics of <i>Dilbert</i>'s cast are based not only on Adams' own corporate experiences, but on the more than 300 e-mails he receives each day about the office dramas of his devoted fans.</p><p>What started as a doodle has turned Scott Adams into a superstar of the cartoon world. <i>Dilbert</i> debuted on the comics page in 1989, while Adams was in the tech department at Pacific Bell.

"Winter's story begins with a peg-leg sailor who aids slaves on their escape on the Underground Railroad.

A couple, their son, and two others make their escape by following the song's directions. Rich paintings interpret the strong story in a clean, primitive style enhanced by bold colors.

Her art with flat colors and perspectives in the folk art tradition have brought her many honors. She lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 2-- Winter's picture book relates the story of an old white sailor called "Peg Leg Joe" who went from plantation to plantation in the pre-Civil War south, teaching enslaved blacks a folksong that he wrote, the lyrics of which held directions for following the Underground Railroad to freedom. This particular story focuses on the journey of one group of runaways who travel according to the directions of the song to reach the Ohio River, where Peg Leg Joe himself is waiting with a boat. Dramatic full-color paintings and a simple text make this part of U.S. history accessible to young readers. However, its emphasis on the role that white people played in the black flight to freedom make it an unbalanced introduction. "Joe had a plan" appears repeatedly in the text, making it sound as though the idea of escape and freedom originated with him, rather than with the people who were living the horror of slavery. Throughout the story, the people who are escaping are depicted as being wholly dependent on the elements and on the actions of benevolent whites, rather than on their own thoughts, ideas, and decisions. This notion is reinforced in picture after picture, as the faces of the five blacks are wide-eyed with fear while they look for the next sign from Joe to tell them what to do. They never show the expressions of courage and determination that mark the faces of the white characters in this book. Follow the Drinking Gourd is aptly titled in that it presents a history of black Americans as followers, rather than as leaders. --Kathleen T.

No one was home at the house on Brattle Street. Old pizza menus were gathering dust on the floor of the front hall, and nothing was in the fridge but a withered apple and several dozen cans of his mother&#x2019;s Diet Coke. So he&#x2019;d dumped his bags and headed out.

The linoleum was worn thin and stained.<br> <br>When he reached the seventh floor, a small metal plaque informed him that Bernstein used to practice here in 1936. Yes, and it didn&#x2019;t look like they&#x2019;d bothered to redecorate it since, Thom thought to himself. He smiled. He was in decent spirits, actually, considering the jet lag, and the girl. At the top, one last door. He jiggled the lock and it swung open.<br> <br>The tower room was small. Dusty. Low ceilings. Surprising, really, given the grandeur of the Eliot tower and dome from the street. In the fading light Thom took in the grand piano hulking in the middle of the room. He&#x2019;d always wondered how the hell they&#x2019;d hauled it up here.<br> <br>But the reason he&#x2019;d come was for the windows. Two huge and perfectly circular windows, each maybe six feet across, one framing each end of the room. The right one was long since painted shut, if it had ever opened. But the left one bore two ancient-looking brass latches. Thom unhooked them and then remembered to kick at the bottom panes, where the paint always stuck a bit. And there it was. The whole window spun open on creaky hinges. He wedged his paper bag into the crack to keep the breeze from slamming it shut again, then hooked a leg over, lowered himself onto the sill, and peered down across the steep slate roof.<br> <br>Senior year, he and his roommate, Joe, sometimes crawled right out across the roof, inching along until they could straddle the dormer windows. They would knock back a few beers and watch the girls crossing the courtyard, their laughter and teasing voices floating up from far below.<br> <br>Now he looked down at the Charles River, curving toward Boston and glowing golden at this hour. On the far bank rose the dome of Harvard Business School. Thom&#x2019;s destiny, the way things were going. He shook the thought from his head and cracked open one of the bottles he&#x2019;d purchased, walking here through Harvard Square. A thick, syrupy oatmeal stout. Not exactly the thing for this summer weather. But studying in England this past year, he&#x2019;d lost his taste for the watery American lager that had been the staple of his weekends here in Eliot House.<br> <br>Thom took another sip and watched the boats gliding along the Charles. Lord knew how many hours he himself had logged on this river. By the time he made varsity crew, the boathouse had felt more central to his college experience than any library, and the blisters across his hands had hardened like tiny stones. A sculler flitted past, then an eight-man crew. Was that Boston University? But why would they be practicing so late, and on summer break at that?<br> <br>He squinted and craned forward, trying to make out what colors were painted on the oars. It was at that moment that hands reached from the shadows behind him. The blow landed at the bottom of his skull. A crack of wood against bone. There was a moment of perfect silence, before Thom swung his strong arms, clawing behind him. But the foot was already on his back. One kick, but hard enough to launch him off the sill and onto the roof ten feet down.<br> <br>He crashed into the pointed tip of a dormer window and rolled, grabbing for a gutter, a ledge, anything. There was nothing, and he fell, wide-eyed, into the gathering twilight below.</p><h2>The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking</h2><p>In the tradition of <em>The Tassajara Bread Book</em>, Brother Curry combines 80 mouth-watering recipes for bread--gathered from Jesuit brothers around the world--with his spiritual insights on meditation through bread-baking.</p><p>Brother Rick Curry, S.J., author of &#34;The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking,&#34; is the founder and artistic director of the National Theater Workshop for the Handicapped.

I&#x2019;m not good with words like you are, so it won&#x2019;t be eloquent, either.<br> <br>Valentine&#x2019;s Day is this weekend. I&#x2019;m in English class, and Mr. Swanson wants us to work on composing romantic sonnets. He&#x2019;s gone over the format twice, but thinking about iambic pentameter and quatrains makes me feel like I&#x2019;m trying to solve a math word problem. At least, I&#x2019;m pretty sure my poetry reads like one.<br> <br>If you were here, I know you&#x2019;d already be done with yours.<br> <br>I also know it would be beautiful.<br> <br>I can see your desk from where I&#x2019;m sitting. I won&#x2019;t find you there even if I look, but part of me is always afraid that I will.<br> <br>Sometimes I wonder if that&#x2019;s what you wanted. For me to be afraid of you. For everyone to be afraid, so no one would try to get close.<br> <br>They tell me that I died. They say that I was dead, and I want to tell them I still am. At least that&#x2019;s how I feel. Because I know where you are and what&#x2019;s become of you. Because I couldn&#x2019;t stop it and I couldn&#x2019;t bring you back. Because Reynolds was right when he told me I couldn&#x2019;t reach you.<br> <br>Everything&#x2019;s broken.<br> <br>And yet here I am, writing you what must be a Valentine.<br> <br>Because even though I know I shouldn&#x2019;t still love you, even though I know that is the last thing I should have room to feel for you, more than anything, I want to tell you I do.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Isobel lifted her shaking pen from the vein-blue lines of her notebook, wondering how the confession had managed to escape her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d never written like that before, where the words just poured out, unstoppable.<br> <br>The final line burned into her retinas, echoing a truth that she&#x2019;d hoped to keep hidden away, locked inside with everything else.<br> <br>She smacked a hand on the paper, crumpling it.<br> <br>What was wrong with her? Why couldn&#x2019;t she let go?<br> <br>Why, when he had let her go?<br> <br>The lunch bell rang, the noise shredding her already frayed nerves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, folks,&#x201d; Mr. Swanson said, standing from behind his desk, his wooden rolling chair sliding back to bump against the chalk tray. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to go ahead and collect these today, even if you&#x2019;re not finished. I&#x2019;ll hand them back tomorrow, so you&#x2019;ll have the first few minutes of class to do some revising, and then I&#x2019;ll grade them over the weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone got up, papers flapping, and the unanimous flutter in the room reminded Isobel of a flock of birds taking wing.<br> <br>Tekeli-li&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Afraid someone might catch sight of Varen&#x2019;s name, Isobel ripped her own rumpled paper free and stuffed it into the middle of the notebook.<br> <br>Glancing up, she saw that Mr. Swanson had moved to the door. Like a ticket taker, he collected papers as her classmates filed into the hall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another reason I should gather these now,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is the simple fact that many a great work of literature has been lost by remaining tucked haphazardly into the pockets and knapsacks of young, carefree scribes such as yourselves. Wanderlust wayfarers, cavalier bards, wistful wordsmiths&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And phat rappers,&#x201d; Bobby Bailey said as he handed Mr. Swanson his sonnet.<br> <br>&#x201c;And portly rappers, why not?&#x201d; Mr. Swanson conceded with a nod, adding Bobby&#x2019;s paper to the accumulating stack.<br> <br>Isobel rose. She tore off the top sheet of her notebook and, gathering her things, kept her head down as she approached the door and its guardian. Handing in the blank paper, she ducked past him into the hall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Miss Lanley,&#x201d; he called after her, his voice carrying over the rising chatter and banging of lockers.<br> <br>Flinching, Isobel stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see thou hast submitted parchment free of words, and thus error. How very avant-garde,&#x201d; Mr. Swanson said, talking in that way he sometimes did, like a Shakespeare character who had somehow clawed his way out from the press of musty book pages.<br> <br>The power of words&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fear not, fair leader of cheers,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;I both recognize and appreciate the temperament of the artist who feels her work is, as yet, unfit for the scrutiny of another&#x2019;s eye. So how about I grant thou till the morrow to turn in yon magnum opus I saw thou scribbling on mere moments ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>She clutched her books tighter.<br> <br>&#x201c;No offense, Mr. Swanson,&#x201d; Isobel heard Katlyn Binkly interject, &#x201c;but I think you read too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grateful for the momentary distraction, Isobel slid alongside Bobby and his basketball friends. Hiding herself between their lumbering forms and the wall, she used them for cover while they headed for the cafeteria.<br> <br>&#x201c;Alas,&#x201d; she heard Mr. Swanson sigh as she moved down the hall, &#x201c;&#x2019;tis entirely possible. But would you have me forfeit my adoration of the written word for such folly as reality TV?&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel steered herself away from Bobby&#x2019;s group and past a senior couple kissing behind an open locker door meant to hide their PDA from Mr. Nott, the hall-slash-lunchroom monitor. The girl had her arms thrown around the boy&#x2019;s neck. In one hand, she clutched a small bouquet, bundled together with baby&#x2019;s breath and wrapped in clear plastic.<br> <br>Isobel halted when she caught sight of crimson buds through the glossy film.<br> <br>Three red roses.<br> <br>Taking notice of Isobel, the girl broke the kiss. Following his girlfriend&#x2019;s gaze, the boy turned his head to see what had interrupted their embrace.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you staring at?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>An infamous question, Isobel thought. One she&#x2019;d been asked before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Taking notes?&#x201d; the girl chimed in.<br> <br>Notes.<br> <br>Isobel moved on without responding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freaking head case,&#x201d; she heard the boy mutter.<br> <br>The whispers didn&#x2019;t bother her anymore, though. Not like they used to.<br> <br>Bypassing the entrance to the lunchroom, she made her way to the side door that led to the courtyard. She wanted to avoid the displays of cardboard-cutout arrow-pierced hearts, dart-shooting cupids, and dangling red-and-white streamers. That meant steering clear of the cafeteria and the gym, both of which had been festooned in decorations.<br> <br>Isobel shoved open the door, and February greeted her with icy breath.<br> <br>As she walked to one of the courtyard&#x2019;s empty stone benches, gathering the escaping wisps of her hair and tucking them behind one ear, her fingertips brushed the cheek that bore a slanted, needle-thin scar.<br> <br>Though the wound had healed, and though she took care to mask it every morning with concealer and powder, Isobel still felt the scar&#x2019;s presence. It carried with it a constant, low-grade pain she could never be certain was real or imagined: a by-product of lingering nerve damage, or a sensation produced from the lasting memory of how she&#x2019;d received the gash.<br> <br>We are ever and always home now.<br> <br>Pinfeathers&#x2019;s final words bubbled up through the mire of haunting echoes in her mind. In spite of herself, she checked the oak tree limbs and scanned the school&#x2019;s roof ledge, searching for any sign of ebony feathers, or the black stare that longed for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? She doubted even he knew.<br> <br>Had known.<br> <br>Isobel set her things down on the bench, unsure of what to do with herself. Wanting to avoid Gwen, she hadn&#x2019;t stopped by their adjacent lockers to pick up her parka or the sack lunch she&#x2019;d made that morning.<br> <br>Since today was Trenton&#x2019;s annual Valentine&#x2019;s Day luncheon, she had told Gwen the previous afternoon that she wanted to spend the lunch break on her own. She&#x2019;d done so as a favor to both of them. So Gwen could be with Mikey without feeling guilty about leaving her alone, and so that Isobel wouldn&#x2019;t have to endure Gwen&#x2019;s sympathetic glances and well-meaning attempts at condolence.<br> <br>Even though Gwen still knew nothing about what had happened after Isobel disappeared through the open tomb door and into the dreamworld, there was one thing her friend could deduce through observation alone.<br> <br>Isobel had failed to return with Varen.<br> <br>As far as Gwen knew&#x2014;as far as anyone knew&#x2014;Isobel remembered nothing. And whether or not Gwen bought the amnesia act, Isobel didn&#x2019;t think her friend had any real inkling as to what had actually occurred. She must have assumed that Varen had been determined to stay. Or worse, that Isobel had found him dead.<br> <br>In a way, it felt like she had.<br> <br>Whatever conclusion Gwen had drawn this time, though, she wasn&#x2019;t asking questions or pushing for answers.<br> <br>Maybe she had learned her lesson in that regard.<br> <br>Maybe now that Gwen had her own losses to take into account&#x2014;a fractured arm and a shattered sense of reality, perhaps even her own nightmares to contend with&#x2014;she would simply give Isobel the slow fade. Like Isobel&#x2019;s crew&#x2014;Stevie, Nikki, and Alyssa&#x2014;Gwen would find a way to bow out and extract herself from Isobel&#x2019;s life. Or, like Brad, she might even convince her family to move to another state.<br> <br>&#x201c;Special delivery,&#x201d; came a voice from behind her, its clipped and all-too-familiar Brooklyn accent instantly negating all of Isobel&#x2019;s theories.<br> <br>Turning, she found Gwen standing a few yards away, her left arm free of its cast but still supported by a navy-blue sling. In her other hand, she held up a small paper basket of food.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mummified cucumbers and petrified potatoes,&#x201d; Gwen said. &#x201c;I hear pickles and Tater Tots are good for what ails you. Of course, I hope you don&#x2019;t mind that I took the liberty of implementing the friend tax by eating the crispy Tots off the top.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mikey?&#x201d; Isobel asked.<br> <br>With a small, chagrined smirk, Gwen jerked her head over her good shoulder toward the cafeteria, where Mikey stood behind one of the wide windows, the side of his face and both palms smashed against the glass. Dressed in a black-and-white checkered hoodie and a pair of sunglasses that sat slanted across his mashed nose, he reminded Isobel of a giant swatted fly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Isobel said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He makes up in skill what he lacks in couth, if you catch my drift,&#x201d; said Gwen with a wink.<br> <br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t Mr. Nott catch him doing that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gwen shrugged, then set the paper basket down on the bench next to Isobel&#x2019;s things. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s trying to cheer you up. You gotta cut him a break, though. He doesn&#x2019;t know anything about, y&#x2019;know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel knew Gwen meant Baltimore. And Varen. And her.<br> <br>Even though Isobel didn&#x2019;t quite get Mikey&#x2019;s allure, she was glad he and Gwen had started dating. Or pseudo-dating or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever was up with them. Mikey&#x2019;s added presence to Isobel and Gwen&#x2019;s locker run-ins and lunch breaks gave Isobel an excuse not to talk about things that fell into the &#x201c;anything&#x201d; category Gwen had mentioned. And a reason for Gwen to continue keeping her questions to herself. Aside from that, though, and perhaps most important of all, Isobel could tell Gwen was falling for the guy.<br> <br>The tipping point, she knew, had been the morning Mikey had flown up to Baltimore to get Gwen&#x2014;January nineteenth, the same morning an anonymous stranger had dropped Isobel off, soaking wet and half-dead, at the city&#x2019;s university hospital.<br> <br>The same morning she&#x2019;d flat-lined.<br> <br>Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s birthday.<br> <br>A week later Isobel had come home with her family. A week after that, she&#x2019;d returned to school to learn through Gwen, during their initial and only private locker visit since Isobel&#x2019;s literal reintegration into reality, that Mikey had used money from a pizza delivery job to buy his plane ticket. Since Gwen had suffered a fractured arm at the hands of Reynolds while trying to help Isobel in the cemetery, the task of making the eleven-hour return drive in her Cadillac had fallen to Mikey as well. According to Gwen, however, he&#x2019;d made the trek in under eight. Having ridden with him the night of the Grim Facade, Isobel didn&#x2019;t find that hard to believe. At all.<br> <br>In addition to filling Isobel in on the details of her return, Gwen had also recounted how Reynolds had run from the police after Isobel had shut him out of the dreamworld. The responding officers, Gwen had said, had seemed determined to detain anyone involved in the scuffle, even if that someone happened to be the Poe Toaster himself.<br> <br>No one had caught him, though. He&#x2019;d vanished, like he did every year, and Gwen had used the distraction of his flight to take refuge behind the headstone he&#x2019;d flung her against. After that, she&#x2019;d made her own escape by slipping into the crowd of onlookers.<br> <br>Because of the overshadowing story that the Baltimore Ravens had lost the finals, missing out on their Super Bowl ticket, the only mention of the Poe Toaster ordeal in the press had been how a few spectators had scaled the cemetery walls. Again.<br> <br>And while Gwen&#x2019;s parents (who thought Gwen had headed to New York to meet up with her cousins for a concert) had bought their daughter&#x2019;s carefully constructed story&#x2014;one that included a mosh-pit mishap&#x2014;Isobel&#x2019;s parents had perceived much more of the truth.<br> <br>Though they knew nothing of Isobel&#x2019;s trip to the graveyard, Gwen&#x2019;s involvement, or how everything tied to Poe, Isobel&#x2019;s mom and dad knew enough to guess that she had gone to the city looking for Varen.<br> <br>Her mother and father had interrogated her a thousand times over as a result. In each instance, Isobel had regurgitated the lie that she remembered nothing past the point of sitting down to dinner at a restaurant with her father.<br> <br>No, she didn&#x2019;t know whose car their Baltimore waitress had seen her climb into. No, she didn&#x2019;t remember where the driver had taken her or why. No, she didn&#x2019;t know who had dropped her off at the hospital. No, she wasn&#x2019;t faking, and no, she wasn&#x2019;t lying. No. No. No.<br> <br>Thankfully, Isobel&#x2019;s psychologist, Dr. Robinson, had instructed her parents to stop the barrage of questions, to carry on with day-to-day life and wait for the memories to resurface on their own.<br> <br>In truth, Isobel would never forget what had happened. Ever.<br> <br>Bloodred rose petals, falling ash, broken shards. Destruction and ruin&#x2014;everything reversed. A beautiful monster and a monstrous beauty. Voices in the corridor. Varen. The cliff&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Her ribbon floating up and away, a fluttering line of pale pink blotted with her own blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pretty bad if you&#x2019;re trying to cheer up a cheerleader, huh?&#x201d; Gwen asked.<br> <br>Isobel blinked from her reverie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a cheerleader anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ehh.&#x201d; Gwen waved her off. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just on sabbatical. You and I both know your feet won&#x2019;t stay fixed to the ground for long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel winced but tried to hide it by glancing at Mikey, who had since started to mime walking up and down an imaginary flight of stairs, his lower body hidden by the school&#x2019;s brick siding. He switched to mimicking rowing a boat just as Mr. Nott appeared behind him, his lined face fixed in a glower.<br> <br>&#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you two are going to the Valentine&#x2019;s Day dance tomorrow, right?&#x201d; Isobel asked.<br> <br>Shifting her weight, Gwen gave her a hooded glare. &#x201c;Like you weren&#x2019;t standing right there when he asked me. Hey, how about I see your obnoxious bid for a subject change and raise you...</p><h2>Getting Stronger : Weight Training for Men and Women</h2><p>For the estimated 26 million Americans lifting weights in 1987, here is the most complete book ever published on weight training. Features an easy-to-use format with one-page training programs that can be photocopied. Over 2,000 illustrations, 45 photos.</p><p>YA Pearl offers a comprehensive introduction to weight training. He cautions readers on ways to avoid injury, but the supervision of a coach is still advisable in high-school weight rooms. Beginning with beginners, Pearl provides guidance on how to structure a fitness program and how to increase the level of fitness attained; he also offers discussion on choosing equipment, human musculature, nutrition, and steroids, as well as ``A Brief History of Resistance Exercise'' by Terry Todd. Exercise programs that are appropriate for general bodybuilding are outlined, as well as those for specific sports (aerobic dance, running, basketball, and triathlon), for fine tuning specific parts of the body, and for exercises with free weights and various name brand machines.

K. Slater, a quirky billionairess who's come to Thalia to open the Rhino Ranch, dedicated to the preservation of the endangered black rhinoceros. Despite their obvious differences, Duane can't help but find himself charmed by K.K.'s stubborn toughness and lively spirit, and the two embark on a flirtation that rapidly veers toward the sexual -- but the return of Honor Carmichael complicates Duane's romantic intentions considerably. As Duane reflects on all that he and Thalia have been through, he feels adrift in a world where love and betrayal walk hand in hand and a stalwart Texas oil town can become home to a nature preserve.</p><p><i>Rhino Ranch</i> is a fitting end to this iconic saga, an emotional, whimsical and bittersweet tribute to the lives of a man and a town that have inspired readers across decades.</p></p><p><b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Tim Gautreaux An old Mississippi mule trader by the name of Ray Lum was fond of saying, "You live and learn. Then you die and forget it all." That about sums up the feeling the reader is left with at the end of Larry McMurtry's elegiac "Rhino Ranch." McMurtry has published nearly 30 novels since 1961 and won a Pulitzer for "Lonesome Dove" (1985). He has written some of the best western fiction in the canon and has made a cottage industry of demystifying the West and shrinking its big skies down to size. In "Rhino Ranch" the tale begins to unfold of a billionaire Texas woman who wants to preserve as many African rhinos as she can buy. She transports them to Thalia, Tex., with the notion of passing them off as a tourist attraction. Several colorful characters hang around a watchtower on the preserve, drink whiskey and kill time. One of these is Duane Moore, whom McMurtry's readers first met in "The Last Picture Show" (1966). He soon becomes a good friend of K.K. Slater, the 52-year-old patron of the rhinos. The animal park subject of the novel never seems to go very far. We don't find out much about rhinos, other than they have to be penned in strong fences and don't like to eat hay. Besides collecting and fencing them in, the owners themselves seem to have only vague notions of what the enterprise is about. One day a rhino breaks out and shadows Duane for a while, and some local yahoos shoot another and saw off its horn, but neither event is fleshed out or developed with much tension. The storytelling skills of, say, McMurtry's "Buffalo Girls" (1990), which was full of great detail and a sense of people having something to lose, are missing. Gradually, the rhinos fade out of the story, which is unfortunate because they are more believable than the weeping urologist and crackpot Texas ranger and other characters who wander in and out of this plot. It turns out that the story is not about animal conservation but about Duane and how he deals with reaching the age of 70 and being alone in the world. His home town looks on him as a stranger, his old compadres are passing away, and Thalia is turning from a real place into a plaything for a bored rich woman and her rhinos. Duane thinks he needs romance, and the narrative introduces a catalogue of female companions including his present wife, a nubile 29-year-old who divorces him early in the novel, probably because he had a heart attack while having sex with her; his much longed-for lesbian psychiatrist; a 17-year-old "adult film" princess who is a master of two-bit porn language; a longshank cook for K.K. Slater who offers her charms in Duane's garden; a perky kid reporter young enough to be his granddaughter who likes to do other people's laundry as a hobby; and a 40-something computer genius, survivor of the Cambodian massacres. It is a mystery why any one of these women is attracted to a superannuated white-bread character like Duane, though he is rich. By the middle of the novel it's obvious that Duane is suffering from the old malaise that afflicts unanchored souls. He spends his time wondering what to do with himself, instead of doing anything of substance. His hobbies seem to be walking the roads around Thalia and starting books he can't understand. He's mystified by the fact that he's sexually unwise and old, yet unhappy. A heart patient, he doesn't seem to see the danger of getting drunk and eating his share of barbecue and chicken-fried steaks. His grandson is the one sane and normal person in the narrative; his take on the Moore clan is that they're "people who spend their lives doing exactly what they want to do, regardless of the feelings and needs of others." McMurtry is good at elegy, whether for the ways of western life or a petered-out oilman. But Duane's diminishing world would be more affecting if McMurtry didn't write about him as if everybody's read the other novels in which he appears. He leaves a lot of stuff out, assuming that we already know Duane, the other characters and what Thalia looks like. At times the prose seems summary in nature, imparting a "let's get this over with" quality. That's too bad, because McMurtry is about important business here. In "Rhino Ranch" he treats his many loyal readers to a last roundup of characters so everyone can have a sense of closure, a view of what happens to them. His ardent fans, the ones who have been on the trail with him since "The Last Picture Show" or "Texasville," will have their fill. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

This argument moves past the notion of ethnicity to examine the growing influence of a handful of major cultures--Western, Eastern Orthodox, Latin American, Islamic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, and African--in current struggles across the globe. Samuel P.

This emotionally riveting account probes the heart without sentimentality or self-pity. <br><br> As the book opens, Richard Lischer&#x2019;s son, Adam, calls to tell his father, a professor of divinity at Duke University, that his cancer has returned. Adam is a smart, charismatic young man with a promising law career, and an unlikely candidate for tragedy. That his young wife is pregnant with their first child makes the disease&#x2019;s return all the more devastating. Despite the crushing magnitude of his diagnosis and the cruel course of the illness<b>,</b> Adam&#x2019;s growing weakness evokes in him an unexpected strength.&nbsp; <br> This is the story of one last summer and the young man who lived it as honestly and faithfully as possible. We meet Adam in many phases of his growing up, but always through the narrow lens of his undying hope, when in the final season of his life he becomes his family&#x2019;s (and his father&#x2019;s) spiritual leader.

He is the author of many books, including <i>Open Secrets: A Memoir of Faith and Discovery</i>. He and his wife live in Orange County, North Carolina.<br></p><p>Seven years ago, on the thirteenth day of April, my son called to tell me his cancer had returned. He was a grown man, but he told me his news like a boy. He said, &#x201c;Hey, Dad, where&#x2019;s Mom?&#x201d; You would have thought he had just put a dent in the family&#x2019;s new car or failed a final exam. He might have been in a little trouble and wanted his mother to buffer the rough edges. He said they had found tumors in quite a few places in his body, on his liver, chest, side, and more. Then he asked me to come to him. And that was all.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was not expecting the call. But then you never are. You are never adequately braced with feet planted and stomach muscles clenched. Just when you should have been steely-eyed, you were caught looking away, distracted by a passing thought, and now it is too late. A police car with its rotating blue light&#x2014;why in my driveway? An envelope marked &#x201c;Personal&#x201d; from someone you don&#x2019;t know. A stranger in uniform who doesn&#x2019;t say hello, but asks you who you are and where you live.<br> &nbsp;<br> A phone call from your son.<br> &nbsp;<br> A familiar voice emerges from a piece of inexpensive black plastic. The voice has no body, and yet it makes a claim as firm and authoritative as flesh. It says &#x201c;Hey, Dad&#x201d; with an end stress on Dad that has always and in every circumstance meant trouble. &#x201c;Hey, Dad,&#x201d; and ordinary time stands still and the room begins to turn while you wait for the rest of the sentence to do its work. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come over to 2 K,&#x201d; it says. The ruin in his voice becomes the new truth in your life, and your old life, the only one you have ever known or wanted, simply vanishes.<br> &nbsp;<br> We addressed each other with an economy of passion, as men will do when they are trying to curtail a feeling, as if what had just passed between us was a new piece of information and not a revelation. We spoke as if the end of the ages had not yet come upon us. I do remember later that evening sobbing into the bedroom wall and hitting it hard with my fist. &#x201c;It is a robbery!&#x201d; I cried. But at the moment of his call, there was shockingly little to say. Our brief conversation left no room for misunderstanding and no remainder of options to be sorted out later. I pressed End on my cell phone and began to make my way from the first floor of the hospital to the clinics in an adjoining building.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even as I was running down corridors, weaving around gurneys, and fumbling with my cell phone to call my wife, something new and forbidden was forming in my imagination. My eyes had begun to burn with a future I was never intended to see. In an ordered world, beginnings and endings are off-limits. A parent is not designed to comprehend the child&#x2019;s life in its entirety, any more than the child is meant to experience the parent&#x2019;s early days or youthful indiscretions. It is a sensible arrangement. Children are not permitted to witness the passions that produced them, and parents are not allowed to observe their children&#x2019;s final hours.<br> &nbsp;<br> It follows that a father has no business writing a book about his son&#x2019;s death. This is proper work for sons, perhaps when they themselves are graying and secure in the world&#x2014;to sum up, round off, and memorialize their fathers. These sons write out of a profound sense of duty toward the generation that preceded them and formed them.<br> &nbsp;<br> With me it is different. My son has become one of the fathers to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I survey my dad, he is always old; he appears as solid and factual as history. But when I steal a glance at my son, what I feel is closer to enchantment, which is a more complicated subject than history, and more compelling. When I look over my shoulder expecting to face the stable and monumental figure of my father, I see an open-faced boy smiling back at me.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was so young and inexperienced he thought he had discovered a new way to die. All my wife and I could do was keep him company and follow him on what he somewhat dramatically called his &#x201c;new path.&#x201d; His new way, which was actually a very old way, carried him beyond the stars to the very origins of his universe and to the source of everything he loved. We traveled the path with him, but at a respectful distance behind him, learning from him and trusting him to show us the way.&nbsp;The last leg of his trip took him exactly ninety-five days. We never imagined how much grace would be required for so brief a journey. Now we rely on it every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t until he got sick that I walked the Stations of the Cross for the first time. Until then, I had never thought of them as anything other than a ritual for pious Catholics and a few venturesome Protestants. But as his illness wore on, the<br> Stations began to loom in my imagination, perhaps because cancer itself leads you from one obligatory shrine to the next. It is a disease that teaches incrementally.<br> &nbsp;<br> In most churches the Stations are so graphic in their depiction of Jesus&#x2019; suffering that they leave little to the imagination: he staggers, he falls, he bleeds, he dies. The ribs protrude from his corpse like piano keys. This is what a young man&#x2019;s death looks like. A few summers ago, when I was teaching at Saint John&#x2019;s University in Minnesota, I noticed something different about the Stations in the abbey church. They were nothing more than plain crosses cut into the granite pavement. They were not designed to restrict the imagination but to expand it and make it more inclusive. When you stand or kneel on one of these cross-shaped slits, as brutal in their own way as the medieval gore they were meant to replace, they remind you that anyone&#x2019;s pain, including your own, can find a place in something larger than itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> It all begins with the Stations. You have to make every last one of them. You have to go with him for his labs and scans, hang out in the coffee shops, walk the dogs, listen to the same old stories, share the same old jokes, and carry on with him for hours about nothing in particular. And when things get serious, you have to keep your part of the bargain and try not to cry. When he wants to talk about God, you have to hide&nbsp;your own damaged faith, clear your palate of clich�s, and find a witness deep within yourself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some pretending is involved. You have to nod sagely when he says, &#x201c;Time is irrelevant,&#x201d; even when you have secretly begun to date your own life from a single telephone call. You have to pretend that you are not counting out his days like silver dollars.<br> &nbsp;<br> All this requires a lot of love, and love is a harsh comforter, because only love makes genuine loss possible. You can&#x2019;t lose what you never loved.<br> &nbsp;<br> A man said to my wife and me, &#x201c;We can give your son back to you.&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, and nearly took the poor man&#x2019;s head off. We were sitting in a richly appointed office around a mahogany desk. &#x201c;You will not give our son back to us.&#x201d; It was a low point. Still, the man was only following a natural if professional instinct, the human instinct to keep, hold, and restore. It&#x2019;s what the poet Julia Kasdorf had in mind when she wrote, &#x201c;Grieving a loss is not only the process of letting go, but it is also the process of keeping, like writing, through acts that allow you to continue to consummate the other.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who grieve have no illusions about denying death or making it into a beautiful experience. We only want to remember in a saving way so that something whole and complete may come into view. To remember in this way is the work of God. My religious tradition calls it Resurrection. If you obey the human instinct to keep and to consummate, you are doing the work of God whether you know it or not. Remembering is a sacred act.<br> &nbsp;<br> And a saving act. &#x201c;How can we know the way?&#x201d; a skeptic once asked Jesus. The time comes when everyone repeats the same bewildered question with the same shattered implication: there is no way. And even if there is, how can anyone know it?&nbsp;My son asked the question, and in my own good time I asked it too. Neither one of us ever got a straight answer, but we were both shown a path. His was marked &#x201c;To Blessedness.&#x201d; Mine was a bit more obscure and overgrown, but it eventually took me to a better place as well. It led me from the bitter gall of losing him to something like a settled sorrow. From &#x201c;It is a robbery&#x201d; to &#x201c;He was my son, and I give thanks for him.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Horror 14</h2><p>Nineteen tales of horror and the supernatural encompass works by such acclaimed writers as Tanith Lee, Ramsey Campbell, Charles Grant, William Nolan, and Dennis Etchison</p><p></p><h2>In Spite of Myself: A Memoir</h2><p>A rollicking, rich portrait of a life.

I won&#x2019;t deny it, &#x2019;tis the truth and nothing but, Your Honour&#x2014;a bumbling, oversized shaggy great Airedale. The earliest memory I have of anything resembling a pater familia, bouncer, male-nurse or God is that dear slobbering old Airedale. My sword, my lance, my shield, he never failed to stand at the ready to rescue me from all my early Moriarties! Wherever I happened to be&#x2014;on the floor, in my bath or on the potty, there&#x2014; looming above me, panting heavily, one large, drooling Airedale reporting for duty, sir! If I went for a ride in my little cart, I would look away and pretend there was no one there at all and then when I did look back, of course he was there. He was always there padding along beside me&#x2014;how could I miss him? He was my only horizon&#x2014; he filled the sky. Like Romulus or Remus, I was his cub and he was my Wolf of Rome. His name was Byng.He was christened after another shaggy old Airedale, Field Marshal Lord Byng of Vimy, whom my grandparents had known when he was governor general; and also for the very good reason that if any of our household showed guts enough to sit down to tea or play a hand at bridge, the day&#x2019;s calm would invariably become a stormy s�ance as tables, taking on a life of their own, began to shake violently and with one quick loud explosion, Bing! they would catapult themselves ceiling-ward as teapots, cups, toast, crumpets, cards and markers flew madly across the room! My canine patron had, quite simply, decided to rise.<i>But I like Byng, my dog, becauseHe doesn&#x2019;t know how to behaveSo Byng&#x2019;s the same as the First Friend wasAnd I am the Man in the Cave</i>(Apologies to Kipling)Nothing ever came between us&#x2014;Your Honour&#x2014;nothing&#x2014;he was my world; I knew no other. Until one day, one sobering day, the spell was broken when a meddling family friend pointed out to me that the nice tall lady pushing my pram was my mother.Mummies and dogs! You can beat &#x2019;em, kick &#x2019;em, treat &#x2019;em as shabbily as you like&#x2014;they will eternally forgive you and still come back for more. Such degree of devotion is as hard to grasp as it is unshakable. Being a child, I had no comprehension of it. It embarrassed me. I regularly ran away from it; in fact, I still do.<i>I didn&#x2019;t throw myself into the struggle for life&#x2014;I threw my mother into it.</i>&#x2014;g. b. shawI came into the world that monster of infant monsters, who can clear a room more swiftly than a Sherman tank; that very monster which causes fear, dread, revulsion to seal the lips of those that dare to speak its name&#x2014;The Only Child! And being an only child I was more than frequently left on my own. Can you blame &#x2019;em?! A little boy&#x2019;s mind can play some pretty macabre tricks on itself. I was so damned terrified of the dark that Mother had to sing me to sleep, snatches of old French songs she particularly loved.<i>Chante, rossignol, chante,Toi qui as le coeur gaiIl y a longtemps que je t&#x2019;aime,Jamais, je ne t&#x2019;oublierai.</i>But the terror never left. It stayed through all the early years. Because of books, which Mother insisted I read, my imagination began to take over, and the long winters gave one so much time to dream up horrors. My grandparents&#x2019; tall, forbidding house in the city could be pretty ominous, full of dark corners to jump out of and scare yourself to death. Every time I tried to rob my grandfather&#x2019;s overcoat pocket of change so I could sneak downtown to Ben&#x2019;s delicatessen for a smoked-meat sandwich and a Coke, some sudden sound would force me to drop everything and run like hell. My room was on the very top floor and in the middle of the night I would steal from my bed and sit shivering on the uppermost step, clinging tight to old Byng, staring down into the center of the long circular staircase, down into that black hole, that bottomless pit, and wait&#x2014;wait for &#x201c;them,&#x201d; whoever &#x201c;they&#x201d; were, to climb up and get us.Every spring we moved to the country. Lingering in the city after school, I generally took one of the late-night trains. As they never knew when I&#x2019;d arrive, there was no family car to meet me and I was obliged to walk the long way home. When finally I reached our gate, I was tired and hungry but there was still some distance to go. Our driveway from the gate to the house was at least a half-mile long&#x2014;it was always dark&#x2014;no streetlamps lit the way. The first portion of the drive was long and straight but suddenly it dipped precipitously and turned a sharp corner. It was next to impossible to see. I could only feel my way and would invariably slip and fall on the loose gravel.The drive resumed, snaking along by a deep swamp to my left near the edge of the lake. The dense woods which made the darkness even more impenetrable gave out a dank fenlike smell. I kept glancing behind as I hurried along but there was never anyone following me. To gain confidence I tried singing, but the sound of my voice was more sinister than the darkness itself, so I quickly gave up. A faint light glowed from the fields to my right and more than once I was sure that I saw, lit by a young moon, a still, solitary figure standing there. I bolted the rest of the way up the hill and it wasn&#x2019;t till I reached the top and could see, through the eight tall poplars the lights from the house beyond, that my heart stopped pounding.<i>Very softly down the glade runs a waiting, watching shade,And the whisper spreads and widens far and near;And the sweat is on thy brow, for he passes even now&#x2014;He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear.</i>&#x2014;RUDYARD KIPLINGMore than once in the mountains north of the city, snowshoeing in the woods, I would lose my way. Night fell and I&#x2019;d stop and stand dead still listening to the wind. The ice-bound trees cracked and rattled like the bones of skeletons. I was sure I would freeze to death. I started to cry and the tears froze against my face&#x2014;little icicles hanging from my eyelids. The wind was stronger now and began to moan and howl through the tops of the pines, a sad and terrifying sound. I was certain at any moment I would be snatched up by that Spirit that hovers high above the trees the half-breeds talk of&#x2014;that carries you away into the sky at such frightening speed that you burn alive. And so the energy that imagination generates warmed me, and at last, I could concentrate and find my bearings.In the snow-covered city, I would ski from the top of Mount Royal down its winding trails past the great stone wall surrounding an estate called Raven&#x2019;scrag and onto our street, Pine Avenue. Often Mother would join me on her skis, but she also loved taking walks up those same trails. Frequently alone, as her selfish wayward son had less and less time for Mummy, she very seldom wore an overcoat even on the most frigid day, just a heavy tweed suit, thick brogues and flowing scarf. Very thirties, very smart, very brave! One late afternoon as I whirled down the hill full speed along by Raven&#x2019;scrag&#x2019;s wall, I saw her coming up toward me on foot. I waved at her as I whisked past and out of the corner of my eye I saw her wave back. When I reached the bottom I looked around, but to my astonishment there was no one there, just an empty hill. I climbed up the trail again on my skis; how could she have disappeared so quickly? Was she behind the wall? But there was no door, hole or space into which she could have vanished. Had my eyes deceived me? Had I seen her at all? I kept still and listened for footsteps on the hard crust&#x2014;there was nothing but silence. The sun dipped behind the mountain and a chill set my teeth chattering. I turned and skied the rest of the way home faster than I had ever made it before.AS A FAMILY we were knee-deep in dogs&#x2014;Canines Unlimited. That was all right by me. I adored them all. But to one in particular, a long- suffering cocker spaniel called Scampy, I am ashamed to say I was rather cruel. We played &#x201c;power games&#x201d; together, instigated by me, of course, and I caused him to suffer a bit, I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2014;just the sort of tricks a lonely, spoiled-brat child with too much time on his hands might play. Until one day I saw something that made me swear that I would never ever hurt an animal of any kind again.It was dead winter in Montreal, an uncomfortable cold, the roads treacherous, icy&#x2014;almost impassable&#x2014;no traffic to speak of. I was staring out of our living room bay window onto the streets below. The familiar little horse-drawn cart carrying coal came clattering with difficulty up the steep hill. The same horse, the same old man that had made this trip together winter after winter since time began. The ancient horse, now almost all bones, was faithfully struggling to reach the summit&#x2014;the old man urging him on with his whip. But the hooves could not get a grip on the ice. The horse bravely kept up the struggle, slipping backwards as he went. The old man, beside himself, gave the poor nag a severe lashing&#x2014;but in vain&#x2014;the horse stopped. He could move no longer. One last lash of the whip proved too much. His heart cracked as he sagged to the ground between the halters. It began to snow. Something heaved inside me&#x2014;I ran from the window to hide and when I returned I looked down and the old man, his livelihood gone forever, was sitting in the middle of the road cradling the horse&#x2019;s head in his arms&#x2014;rocking back and forth in silent grief as the big gentle flakes began to cover everything beneath them in a warm soft blessing.<i>There&#x2019;s an island deep down in my sleepA lost land I long to findBut I wake &#x2019;ere I reach the islandSo it must only live in my mind.It could be the dream we yearn forThat on earth we may never attainBut I know there was love on that islandFor it chased away all of my pain.</i>If you looked through the oaks and the balm of Gilead across the bay from our country house on the shore, you could just see the island. You couldn&#x2019;t always quite make it out, not all at once, and sometimes it simply decided in its mischievous way to hide behind a fog&#x2014;but from my earliest infancy, I knew it was there. It seemed to float on its own, just a little above the water, not too permanent a thing as if, free of its moorings, it would drift away at any moment. I just hoped it wouldn&#x2019;t forget me but beg me to follow.It had a habit of disappearing and reappearing through the mist and beckoning . . . always beckoning. When I grew older I was allowed to go there with my mother. It was like playing truant; it was the most wonderful escape. It didn&#x2019;t take me long to realize it was an escape for Mother too.It belonged to her greatest friend&#x2014;a lady of similar age with the warmest, most sympathetic of hearts and the deepest, darkest, most beautiful eyes I had ever seen. Her name was Pauline but everyone called her &#x201c;Polly&#x201d; and the island was &#x201c;Polly&#x2019;s Island.&#x201d; She was Canadien Fran�ais, spoke a little of all sorts of languages and her English was unique. Her voice was coated with a husky timbre which was not unmusical and in an extraordinary way enhanced her attractiveness; its Creole-like drawl made you want to smile. It gave her conversation an unusual extravagance&#x2014;an almost theatrical cadence&#x2014; she elongated her &#x201c;ma ch�res,&#x201d; affectionately stretching them out to infinity. When she spoke, the world was an easy place to be in. She made me feel as grown-up and as wise as she, and she listened as if I were her only friend.The island on weekends overflowed with guests from all over the globe, it seemed, considering the variety of tongues, and Polly, with breathtaking ease, practiced her phenomenal talent for making everyone feel that this was perhaps the only home they&#x2019;d ever had. No one wanted to leave. Whenever there was a crowd, Mother and I knew just where to hide. On the way up to the house there was a bridge where we could stare down at the giant lily pads that carpeted the black waters below. There were lots of mysterious paths through the woods with surprise openings where we could both get splashed from the waves crashing against the shore; the swimming hole, with a raft you could swim out to, the stables which housed the ponies, and the inlets through which we would paddle our canoe and watch the bitterns stand on one leg or listen to the long sad chorale of the frogs.Polly had the most exquisite eye, and there was always the heady fragrance of fresh-cut flowers that penetrated every room. The great screened-in porch with its burnt-sienna tiles where cool drinks were served was the place to while away many an hour looking out across the lawn to the far point at the island&#x2019;s tip and watch the sun go down. This enchanted isle would remain for me throughout my life, a hidden world . . . a place lodged firmly in the heart. It also became for me all the islands I never knew, perhaps too far at times to reach, and almost always, a little too wondrous to be true.<i>Lord Ronald said nothing; he flung himself from the room,flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.</i>&#x2014;stephen leacock</p><h2>The Art of the Scarf: From Classic Knots and Chic Neckties, to Stylish Turbans, Makeshift Bags, and More</h2><p><b>Discover the transformative power of the scarf; a miracle accessory that has the ability to make a basic outfit look extraordinary</b><br><br>Anyone can wear a scarf, and nearly every woman will have one tucked away in her wardrobe.

Using such fictional enticements, the author of What Is the Name of This Book? and To Mock a Mockingbird steers us through the logical thickets of Kurt Godel's famous Incompleteness Theorem, which holds that mathematical systems can never prove their own consistency. Readers who make it halfway through this book will learn more symbolic logic than a college freshman stuffed with "new math." In the second half, the deeper waters of modal logic are navigated. This field, which dates back to Aristotle, impinges on current debates in computer science and artificial intelligence. Smullyan's gift is to make complex ideas both accessible and enjoyable to the persevering reader. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Godel's incompleteness theorem is generally considered to have shown that formal number systems cannot prove their own consistency. Through a series of problems and solutions ("On the Island of Knights and Knaves, knights always make true statements and knaves always make false statements, and every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave . . . ") that are converted to symbolic logic, Smullyan progresses from an elementary to an advanced consideration of Godel's theorem. Apart from a few remarks at book's end, Smullyan makes no attempt to show what bearing Godel's results might have on more general, particularly epistemological, problems. Serious students of logic, computer theory, and artificial intelligence should find this entertaining and instructive, but it cannot be recommended for a larger audience. Leon H.

In Berkeley, California, in its hippie heyday, he found methamphetamine and LSD and heroin. He sniffed nitrous oxide in Malaysia and frequented Calcutta's opium dens. Ultimately, though, his journey took him where it takes most addicts: into a life of addiction, desperation, deception, and crime.<p>But unlike most addicts, Lewis recovered and became a developmental psychologist and researcher in neuroscience. In <i>Memoirs of an Addicted Brain</i>, he applies his professional expertise to a study of his former self, using the story of his own journey through addiction to tell the universal story of addictions of every kind. He explains the neurological effects of a variety of powerful drugs, and shows how they speak to the brain&#x2014;itself designed to seek rewards and soothe pain&#x2014;in its own language. And he illuminates how craving overtakes the nervous system, sculpting a synaptic network dedicated to one goal&#x2014;more&#x2014;at the expense of everything else.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Marc Lewis</b> is a developmental neuroscientist and professor of human development and applied psychology at Radboud University in the Netherlands, and professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.

It was a March night and freezing cold. I had been at Tabor less than six months, and depression was now a palpable daily companion, a disease to be managed. There were good days and bad days, but the good days were just tolerable and the bad days nearly did me in. I hated this school. It was bigger than me, it was stronger than me, and it seemed as natural a part of the New England landscape as the rocky coves and stands of maple. I didn&#x2019;t belong here. I had got here by mistake. My first two years of high school had been at a nice, normal suburban Toronto school a few blocks from my home. I might not have been the most popular kid in class, but nobody seemed to actively dislike me. I had a few friends. I got invited to a few parties. I had a girlfriend for a couple of months. And I could go home at night. That was the main thing. Here at Tabor, there was no home to return to at the end of the day&#x2014;except the dorm. And I hated the dorm. I hated every whitewashed board, every hissing radiator, every creak in the polished hardwood floors. I hated my room, I hated my roommate. I hated the guy next door. And I hated my proctors, the senior boys whose job it was to supervise us and care for us while helping induct us into this bizarre paramilitary culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>Para-naval, actually. Tabor was a para-naval academy, but that didn&#x2019;t mean much to me at the time. The naval terminology seemed a bad joke, an effort to reenact the Hollywood heroism of World War II. We would sometimes see men who looked like admirals strolling the pathways with the headmaster. Gold stripes on dark blue cuffs. There were special prayers at vespers, navy uniforms to be ironed and worn a few weeks a year, drill sessions with guns and a marching band. And yes, we were located on a body of water and there were a lot of boats: sailboats, rowboats, crew boats, a schooner out in the harbour. It was the boats that had attracted me in the first place, the previous spring in Toronto.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Marc, we&#x2019;d like to talk to you about your options for next year,&#x201d; my mother had said in her frank, slightly invasive tone.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What options?&#x201d; I was beckoned to the kitchen table, where I sat down with both parents. The table was covered with pamphlets from different private schools, most of them in New England. &#x201c;You seem a little bored with school,&#x201d; Mom continued. &#x201c;And maybe a bit discontent overall?&#x201d; Those penetrating eyes&#x2014;hazel and clear with mildly arched brows&#x2014;scanned me for an accuracy reading. They gazed at me steadily from her pretty, mid-thirtyish face&#x2014;a face surrounded by sprayed-in-place hair that became increasingly blonde as the sixties wore on. My mother seemed to wield her own sixth sense. She could look into me and find things. As usual, I soon felt I must be hiding whatever it was she was looking for.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Mom. Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; My dad sat beside her, hunched over and uncomfortable. His pleasant features, thin black hair, and solemn brown eyes would have been more at home at a meeting of the family-run leather business. Dad didn&#x2019;t usually get involved in family discussions with an emotional theme, if that&#x2019;s what this was. Maybe he was in the dark as much as I was. His half-smile tried to make light of things. But this was sounding ominous.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But remember we talked about boarding schools? And you said you might be interested?<br>&nbsp;<br>Remember, we&#x2019;ll be moving to San Francisco in two years&#x2019; time. Going to an American school would save you a year of high school. You&#x2019;d be able to go straight to college the year we arrive. So . . .&#x201d; she smiled encouragingly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done my homework and gotten these pamphlets from some very fine schools. And we thought,&#x201d; with a glance at my dad, &#x201c;that you might want to look at them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It all seemed exciting, though too far off to think about. So I looked at the pamphlets piled up in front of me. We looked together, and my parents pointed out this and that feature of this and that school. I tried to pay attention, but my thoughts wandered like stray cats. I was preoccupied&#x2014;some sort of creeping disorientation at the very prospect of leaving home. And beneath that, intangible but potent, a sense of dread. Were they trying to get rid of me? Had I done something wrong?<br>&nbsp;<br>Now Tabor was my world: there was nothing left to decide. Every morning I joined four hundred other teenage boys tramping along a wooden walkway between brick buildings in a cold mist, breakfast settling, the assembly hall looming, thinking about ways to avoid attention. Our headmaster, Mr. Witherstein, looked as though he&#x2019;d stepped out of an old movie. He parted his hair almost dead centre, and he was grey and crusty like a venerable admiral himself. He waited for us at the lectern, beaming with unnatural enthusiasm. He delighted in the series of routine announcements that he would soon recite with such gravity. I took my assigned seat. Each seat back held a short wire rack containing a hymnal. I reached toward mine automatically, on cue. We opened our hymnals together, the rustle of pages filling the hall, and we began to sing.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A mighty fortress is our God! A bulwark never failing. </i>God had never appeared to me as a fort or a bulwark. Maybe that was because I was Jewish. Yet I didn&#x2019;t mind the singing. It numbed me. There was a comforting anonymity in being a part of this mass, this sea of boys packed row after row in a heated auditorium. I was safe for now. Back at my dorm, it was survival of the fittest, and I wasn&#x2019;t all that fit. A pecking order had consolidated in the early months, and I was pretty close to the bottom. At first my roommate, Todd, was the victim of some pretty vicious teasing by just about everyone, but especially Bill Reed, the handsome giant who lived in the room next door. Reed was a front-line football player, though still a junior, and for that alone he was universally admired. Todd put some sort of lotion on his face at night, giving it an awful vampiric whiteness, all the more disturbing with his black stubble poking through. He was soon known to one and all as Madame Butterfly. I was sympathetic at first, but I didn&#x2019;t like him much. He was caustic, whiny, and sour. I tried to like him. I tried to be nice to him. But I secretly hoped that his victimization would keep me safe, give me some breathing space.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, Reed had risen rapidly to power. His own roommate, Randy, was an absurd-looking, gangly outcast, with protruding ears, perfectly designed by nature for the role of village idiot. And he was Reed&#x2019;s roommate! I felt sorry for Randy. What torments must he suffer? But I was relieved that Reed was surrounded by victim material. Although I knew that was selfish, I needed it to be so. I needed the playing field tilted in my favour.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, to my horror, it tilted the other way. The dominance hierarchy heaved a final time and Randy and Todd ended up Reed&#x2019;s lieutenants, his slaves. Randy brought him anything he asked for. He literally stood around, waiting for orders. Todd found his niche fawning over Reed from the sidelines, grinning at his savage jokes and heaping ridicule on his victims.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was next in line.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey Lewis!&#x201d; Reed smiled at me almost warmly from the doorway connecting our rooms. His broad, manly features beamed with good humour.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come on in. Join the party.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t refuse.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did you see what happened to my dresser?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Take a look.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come closer.&#x201d; He seemed so inviting. I wanted to believe that I was really being included. But I didn&#x2019;t see anything unusual.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Closer!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bring your head right up to the edge here, ya dummy. You have to look at it from just the right angle.&#x201d; I did as I was told, moving my face to within inches of the dresser surface. There seemed to be a pool of water there.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I see some water. How did that happen?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then smash! His palm came down hard on the little puddle; my face was soaked. And whatever was running down my cheeks stung my eyes, which started instantly to tear. Aftershave? Hydrochloric acid? Liquid shame? My tears were the worst part.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How did that happen?&#x201d; Reed echoed in mincing tones. &#x201c;How did that happen?&#x201d; His voice rose with incredulity while he danced around the room. &#x201c;Did it make you cry, Lewis? Poor baby, we&#x2019;d better call your Mama,&#x201d; and they all erupted into laughter, Reed, Randy, Todd, and another guy. I looked through tears at Reed&#x2019;s grinning hyena mask, curling now with contempt, and I wanted to slip through the floor. <i>What was wrong with me?!</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>I began to avoid my dorm whenever I could, to synchronize my comings and goings with those of the other boys, so Reed couldn&#x2019;t get me alone. I made a couple of friends and that helped. There were other misfits who had no interest&#x2014;and generally no place&#x2014;in the jock-dominated hierarchy. By Christmas I spent a lot of time with Schwartz and Burton. Joe Schwartz was a junior like me, but he was leather-tough in some unique way. Self-sufficient and really smart. Burton was just a big teddy bear, gruff and mischievous, whom nobody could dislike. I got to know their friends, Gelsthorpe, Perry, and Norris, all seniors. These were the guys who would graduate at the end of the year, and they all lived in another dorm, Pond House. I spent a lot of time at Pond House, and I wished I could switch. But at night I had to return to my own dorm, with its sixteen boys, often creeping up the back stairs to avoid notice. Sometimes, before going to my room and facing Todd, I&#x2019;d drop in on Lawrence Carr, one of the two black kids at Tabor. That&#x2019;s two out of four hundred. The other one, Lavalle, was despised by all: he wore his bitterness like an armband. But Carr stayed above the fray and was left alone. In my eyes he was magnificent.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How do you handle it?&#x201d; I wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I take it all for granted,&#x201d; he replied. His smile was gentle, chiding.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What did you expect, man? Tabor is no temple of brotherhood. It is exactly what it appears to be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just wait it out. Keep your own council.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It seemed easy for him.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I finally learned how to avoid Reed&#x2019;s displays of goodwill, trouble came from a guy named Roche who lived across the hall. Passing his door became an agony of nerves.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A Jew! A Jew! Excuse me! I mean ah-choo! Bless me! Hey Lewis, did you hear someone sneeze?&#x201d; His voice rang with feigned bafflement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Roche was rotund and greasy, with small eyes and a blistering tongue. He sat chinless, unmoving, on a chair well inside his room, opposite the door, waiting for fresh bait to pass within range without his having to move from his lair. I was bait. Defenceless bait.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let them know they&#x2019;re getting you down,&#x201d; my mother advised on the phone. &#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t get a reaction, they&#x2019;ll stop.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That was probably the worst advice I&#x2019;d ever got from anyone. Or maybe I just didn&#x2019;t know how to implement it. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how I might pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t getting me down. It crushed me! Roche could see my face as I hurried by or see me looking down, avoiding his gaze.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I soon got more potent advice from an unlikely source, a boy named Miles. He was a loner like Carr, and confident like Carr&#x2014;in fact contemptuous of the scurrying cruelty around him. I sat at the foot of his bed one night, looking at unfathomable pictures of his enormous home in the Deep South.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lewis,&#x201d; he asked, leaning regally against the headboard, &#x201c;why do you let Roche pick on you?&#x201d; He studied me carefully, trying to discern the peculiar defect that must be there.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t . . . mean to. What choice do I have?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What choice?&#x201d; He snorted with mild disgust. &#x201c;Lewis, your problem is that you have no common sense. You&#x2019;re an intelligent kid, but you don&#x2019;t know how to use it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What should I do?&#x201d; If there was some workable trick, I wanted badly to know it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Look at Roche. Does he have any weaknesses?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, no. He&#x2019;s got lots of friends in fact.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but is there anything about him that&#x2019;s . . . that he&#x2019;s not proud of? That he doesn&#x2019;t want his friends to see?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just that he&#x2019;s fat, I guess.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Peek Inside a Fairytale Little Red Riding Hood</h2><p>Journey into the woods with Little Red Riding Hood, peeking through the trees, lifting flaps to see what&#39;s beneath things, and watching granny&#39;s cottage emerge with each turn of the page.

He awoke to find himself very much wanted. For in the night murder had been committed. Mr. Ratchett, an American millionaire, was found lying dead in his berth&#x2014;stabbed. The untrodden snow around the train proved that the murderer was still on board. Poirot investigates.

"Danilo Culture" is the eponymous name bestowed on a culture flourishing in the period from about 5500-4500 BC at Danilo and at some neighbouring sites. This culture had great influence along the eastern Adriatic coast and its hinterland and produced a significant number of these vessels. Rhyta, which other Neolithic cultures also made, were dispersed throughout a vast area of southeast Europe, from Greece to the Alps. This book is an in-depth study of that mysterious, prehistoric archaeological artifact which, due to its antiquity, structure and symbolism, has become a kind of universal proto-matrix for all relevant mythological and spiritual structures of the Mediterranean zone of later, historic times.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction: Archaeology and the Symbol<br> 1.

Rak has read widely and thoughtfully in the archaeological literature, so that his discussions of the strictly archaeological aspects of his topic are well grounded. He has also explored other literatures, in anthropology, philosophy, mythology, and much else besides, and has applied a variety of perspectives derived from these sources to his subject. (Andrew M. T. Moore <i>American Journal Of Archaeology</i>)<br><br>Following Peric&#x301;&#x2019;s (1996) study, this book by Omer Rak is the second comprehensive study of this particular type of vessel, translated into English from the Croatian language. Rak&#x2019;s book about the Neolithic rhyton from Danilo is without a doubt an important contribution to the discussion of ritual objects which this reviewer &#x2013; even if he cannot agree with several of the author&#x2019;s statements &#x2013; enjoyed reading because it connects different traditions of Old Europe and beyond. Rak has painted a colourful picture of Neolithic beliefs, which is one aspect of the past that scientific discourse tries to shed light on.

The teachings are drawn from the talks and writings of Morihei Ueshiba, founder of the popular Japanese martial art of Aikido, a mind-body discipline he called the "Art of Peace," which offers a nonviolent way to victory in the face of conflict. Ueshiba believed that Aikido principles could be applied to all the challenges we face in life&#x2014;in personal relationships, as we interact with society, and at work and in business. <br><br>This edition is a much-expanded version of the original miniature edition that appeared in the Shambhala Pocket Classics series. It features a wealth of new material, including a biography of Ueshiba; an essay by John Stevens that presents Ueshiba's views on "The Art of War versus the Art of Peace"; newly translated <i>doka, </i>didactic "poems of the Way"; and Ueshiba's own calligraphies.</p><p>Morihei Ueshiba (1883&#x2013;1969) was the founder of Aikido. At age eighteen, Ueshiba joined the Japanese military, during which time he also developed his skills in the martial arts. He eventually left the military, deeply discouraged by the death and destruction that results from combat. Ueshiba continued to experiment with a variety of martial arts, finding particular joy in the spiritual aspects of martial arts. He came to believe that a real warrior was one who was rooted in love, and it was in this spirit that he began to develop Aikido, a martial art that emphasizes harmony and the peaceful resolution of conflict.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Wide As the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired</h2><p>The dramatic story of the &#34;English bible&#34; is told here, with vivid details of how King James assembled a team of experts, including John Wyclif and William Tyndale, to translate the text into English and examines the political, social, cultural, and spiritual ramifications of the King James Bible. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Benson Bobrick's <i>Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired</i> is a brisk and gripping work of history, religion, and literary criticism. Translation of the King James Bible took centuries to complete, and Bobrick provides colorful descriptions of the distinctive contributions of various translators who took part in the project, particularly John Wyclif in the 15th century and William Tyndale in the 16th century. (Tyndale, he points out, is the second most widely quoted writer, after Shakespeare, in the English language ["eat, drink, and be merry," is Tyndale's phrase; so is "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak"].) <i>Wide as the Waters</i> interprets each translator's work according to its contemporary political context in England. The book's most dramatic passages are found in its account of Henry VIII's showdown with Rome, which resulted in (among other things) Tyndale's execution. Although Bobrick may overstate the singularity of the Bible's influence on the English Revolution (he asserts that the concepts of liberty and free will that guided revolutionaries who overthrew Charles I were primarily derived from the King James Bible), his argument is, at the very least, an effective and engaging reminder of Scripture's liberating power. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Benson Bobrick</b> earned his doctorate from Columbia University and is the author of several critically acclaimed works, including <i>Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired </i>and<i>&nbsp;Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution</i><i>.</i> In 2002 he received the Literature Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Rich in culture, art, and charm, the Eternal City is also home to some of the most delicious and accessible cooking in all of Italy. Influenced by both the earthy peasant fare of the surrounding hillsides and the fish from the nearby Mediterranean, Roman food makes the most of local ingredients and simple, age-old techniques. Yet while Italian cookbooks abound, no American book has focused on Romes unique and varied fare. In this beautifully illustrated cookbook, author David Downie and photographer Alison Harris offer a comprehensive collection of more than 125 Roman recipes, exploring the lively, uncomplicated food traditionally served in Roman homes and trattorie. From well-known dishes like Spaghetti Carbonara, to popular snack food like Pizza Bianca, to distinctive specialties like Roast Suckling Lamb, each recipe in <em>Cooking the Roman Way</em> is simple, authentic, and easy to make at home. With four-color photographs of landmarks, markets and food, stories about and profiles of food vendors, entertaining anecdotes, and a food lovers guide to the streets of the city, this book paints a vivid picture of Rome and the food that has sustained it for millennia.</p></p><p>David Downie's delectable <i>Cooking the Roman Way</i> begins with an irresistible invitation: "Close your eyes and imagine you're in Rome, seated al fresco in the sun on a rooftop terrace...." This is a must-have cookbook for anyone who loves Italy and its food, serious cooks and armchair cooks alike. The recipes are simple, well-researched, and perfectly authentic. Downie delivers history and tradition so vividly you feel as though you went to Rome and learned these facts for yourself, and Alison Harris's photos help make that impression all the more real.<p> The more than 100 recipes are divided by course. Antipasti include the venerable Sweet-And-Sour Baby Pearl Onions, even more addictive than, Downie warns, Farro Risotto Balls with Basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano, little deep-fried nuggets of comfort food. Primi piatti include the aromatic Fennel and Bean Soup with Cherry Tomatoes, Mint, Basil, and Sage, and plenty of pasta recipes, any of which would make a great meal. Secondi cover meat, poultry, fish, and eggs, and include the marvelously rich Roman Oxtail Stew, and Spicy Boned Lamb Leg Saut�ed with Rosemary, Wine, and Vinegar. Contorni are vegetables and side dishes, such as Sweet Pepper Rolls Stuffed with Cheese and Anchovy, and dolci include desserts such as Ricotta Lemon Fritters with Sambuca and Fresh Strawberry Tiramisu. Beautiful enough to give as a gift, easy enough to use every day, Downie will definitely have you <i>Cooking the Roman Way</i>. <i>--Leora Y.

Moving between tragedy and savage comedy, desperation and joy, McGahern�'s first novel, <i>The Barracks</i>, is one of haunting power. Elizabeth Reegan, after years of freedom�&#x2014;and loneliness�&#x2014;marries into the enclosed Irish village of her upbringing. The children are not her own; her husband is straining to break free from the servile security of the police force; and her own life, threatened by illness, seems to be losing the last vestiges of its purpose.</p><p>John McGahern was born in Dublin and brought up in the west of Ireland. He is the author of three collections of short stories and six novels, including <i>Amongst Women</i>, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.Celebrated Irish author McGahern has written six novels, most recently <i>By the Lake</i> (2002) and four short story collections. This is the first U.S. publication of his first novel, which was written in 1963. It is the story of Elizabeth Reegan, who, after years of being alone, marries a widower with three children. Her husband, a policeman, is a hard and bitter man who never passes up the opportunity to stick it to his rule-mongering boss. Endless chores and her deep awareness of her inability to soothe her husband's restlessness or to be an essential part of her stepchildren's lives have left Elizabeth dispirited. When she learns that she has breast cancer, her feelings about the futility of her life deepen, but she also sees the value in trying to meet her fate with dignity. Shot through with fatalism and told in reserved and beautiful prose, this authoritative novel conveys both the bleakness of the Irish civil servant's lot in the 1960s and the courage needed to face down frustration and despair. <i>Joanne Wilkinson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Alexander, F.R.G.S. Cartographer, Map Division, New York Public Library<br>Early map making was characterized by secrecy. Maps were precious documents, drawn by astrologers and travelers, worn out through use or purposely destroyed. Just as men first mapped the earth indirectly, via the sun and stars, so must the history of maps be approached circuitously, through chronicles, astronomy, Strabo and Ptolemy, seamanship, commerce, politics. From the first determination of latitude 2000 years ago through the dramatic unraveling of longitude 1700 years later, the story of maps plots the course of civilization. This book charts the course with a breadth and depth still unsurpassed in a scholarly survey.<br>Lloyd A. Brown's cartographic erudition came through his years as librarian of the Peabody Institute, Baltimore, and as curator of maps at the Clements Library, University of Michigan, where he devised a system for classifying and cataloging some 25,000 old maps. He researched <i>The Story of Maps</i> over four years, seeking out as many pertinent sources as possible for a definitive history and summation of map lore.<br><i>The Story of Maps</i> follows the peaks and declines of western societies, with marine and topographic knowledge flourishing secretly with the sea powers of Minoan Crete and the Phoenicians, surfacing again with Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Ptolemy, then waning until the Crusades brought travel and trade back to prominence. The Genoese, Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and English all had their years of hegemony, great navigators and charts, aided by the mapping ideas of Mercator and Edward Wright. The most brilliant minds of the era, including Galileo and Newton, attempted to solve the problem of longitude at sea; the solution came from a Yorkshire clockmaker named John Harrison, who won a 20,000 pound prize for his pains.<br><i>The Story of Maps</i> celebrates cartography from Strabo to World War II. Eighty-six remarkable illustrations, including early maps, prints and portraits, many unique and seen only in museums, supplement the texts. The exhaustive bibliography matches the text in span and usefulness for those who will undoubtedly be stimulated by this book to read more regarding maps.</p><p></p><h2>Claudia and the Genius of Elm Street (The Baby-Sitters Club #49)</h2><p>Hired to baby-sit seven-year-old Rosie Wilder, Claudia is at first impressed by the girl&#39;s accomplishments--she can sing, act, dance, and play the piano--but soon Rosie&#39;s talents begin to annoy Claudia</p><p></p><h2>Hooked on Phonics Learn to Read - Level 3: Word Families (Early Emergent Readers | Kindergarten | Ages 4-6) (3)</h2><p><b>Hooked on Phonics</b>�&nbsp;<i>Learn to Read Level 3</i> is the first Kindergarten level in the complete 8-level <i>Learn to Read</i> series.<br> - Level 1: All About Letters (Pre-K)<br> - Level 2: All About Letters (Pre-K)<br> <b>- Level 3: Word Families (Kindergarten)</b><br> - Level 4: Word Families (Kindergarten)<br> - Level 5: Beginning Phonics (First Grade)<br> - Level 6: Beginning Phonics (First Grade)<br> - Level 7: Intermediate Phonics (Second Grade)<br> - Level 8: Intermediate Phonics (Second Grade)<br> <br> Designed to help your child learn the building blocks of reading, <i>Learn to Read Level 3</i> covers:<br> - A Review of Letter Names and Letter Sounds<br> - Short &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;i&#x201d; Vowel Sounds<br> - Adding &#x201c;-s&#x201d; to Nouns and Verbs<br> - 16 New Sight Words<br> <br> This set includes:<br> - 6 Original Storybooks written to reinforce the skills your child learns in the program<br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Cat</i><br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Tag</i><br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Pig</i><br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The Kit</i><br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- In the Bin</i><br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The Rats</i><br> - 1 Bonus Book, <i>Tim and Sam</i>,&nbsp;by the award-winning children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator David Ezra Stein<br> - 1 Workbook that will guide you and your child through all of the lessons and many fun activities<br> - 1 DVD filled with music videos and fun introductions to each lesson, where letters come to life<br> - 1 Set of Stickers to proudly display in the workbooks and celebrate reading success<br> - 1 Quick Start Guide<br> <br> Designed in conjunction with leading educators, award-winning authors, teachers and parents, <b>Hooked on Phonics�</b> <i>Learn to Read</i> uses a proven, simple, and fun method to give your child a strong foundation in phonics and reading skills.<br> <b>- Learn</b>: Your child learns to read new words by watching the DVD and reading the workbook.<br> <b>- Practice</b>: Your child practices reading the new sound combinations and words in the workbook.<br> <b>- Read</b>: Your child puts it all together to read a great story.<br> <b>- Celebrate</b>: Celebrate success after each lesson and track your child&#x2019;s progress!</p><p>At Hooked on Phonics, we believe that every child loves to learn, so we focus on nurturing that thirst for knowledge with products that are fun, effective, and easy to use.&nbsp;We respond to a child&#x2019;s natural curiosity and support families and teachers as they help children improve literacy skills.

Having goals in life is a good thing, and working hard to make a name for yourself and achieve something big are good things too. That&#x2019;s what the American Dream is all about. Many of us spend our lives trying to have it all, or at least to be seen as having it all.<br><br>We crave success. We need significance. Ultimately, we want our lives to count for something, something that matters. But in addition to all that, we would love to gain respect, power, position, and prestige&#x2014;because those are things that help us feel valued.<br><br>And then there is money. Whether we admit it or not, we enjoy the things money brings. We love comfort, and we want to feel secure. These are things we build our American lives on.<br><br>But what if you were making steady progress in most of the areas of life that bring comfort, security, earthly significance, and maybe even wealth, and then you found out that you were doing life all wrong? What if that realization led you to radically change the trajectory of your life? And what if changing your life meant that you would also reroute the lives of your spouse and your teenage children?<br><br>That is what happened to my family.<br><br>My husband, Curt, and I had a life that most American couples aspire to. We had career achievements, work that fit our talents and interests, two great kids, and a comfortable home in an area we loved. We considered ourselves &#x201c;serious&#x201d; Christians who were involved in our church and ready to serve when needs arose. It was easy to share what we had, because even after sharing we had more than enough left over.<br>There was no earthly reason why we should start questioning the legitimacy of our lives.<br><br>But we did question it, and in seeking answers we changed just about everything that we had looked to for our security, our identities, and our places in the community.<br><br>Meaning, identity, goals, success. These things drive us, and living in America gives us readymade ways to seek to fulfill these basic needs. What&#x2019;s wrong with driving a reliable car, living in a comfortable home, and sending our children to good schools where they can excel academically and shine in the areas where they have been gifted?<br>Aren&#x2019;t these the standards we all reach for?<br><br>Curt and I reached for that standard and exceeded it. And having achieved the goals we set for ourselves, we were still asking, &#x201c;Who and what am I living for? Myself? My children? My career? My income? My reputation? A promotion? A bigger house? A more expensive car? Retirement?&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe you have asked some of these same questions. Perhaps you have achieved far more than we had by age forty. Maybe you achieved these things long before you hit forty. It&#x2019;s possible you are still working hard to lay hold of your goals. Or maybe you have reached a place in life where comfort and security and status and success have lost their luster.<br><br>If you have started asking, &#x201c;What is it that I&#x2019;m living for?&#x201d; I hope reading the story of the Alan family from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, will help point you to some answers. I hope our experience will lead to a shared pursuit of how God is leading His people to<br>fulfill the basic human needs of meaning, significance, identity, and success.<br><br>Make no mistake. I am not a woman who turned her life around as a desperate response to having suffered deep tragedy. My story is just the opposite. I was living a life that I absolutely loved. I was happy, and I had it all.<br><br>Curt and I had surpassed our dreams. I felt blessed. I certainly wasn&#x2019;t looking for a change. Why would I? I couldn&#x2019;t think of any change that would improve on the life we already had. Yet God had a life waiting for me that I couldn&#x2019;t see because I was so intoxicated by my myopic definition of a great life. I was impressed by how well Curt<br>and I had done.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t realize that I had traded life for a lie. I had no idea that my heart had grown hard and unaware of the things that matter to God. I had learned to be content with what I later came to realize was the least important aspect of life.<br><br>Here is part of the lie that is easiest for us to buy into. We are convinced that when we go into overdrive to assure the safety and comfort of our family&#x2014;positioning everyone for success&#x2014;that God is pleased with us. Good parents make sure their kids have everything they need to ensure a successful outcome. It stands to reason that a responsible parent does not want his or her children to suffer or fail. It&#x2019;s all about<br>providing them with security and stability.<br><br>Here is the truth we often are blinded to: when we live for safety and comfort and success, we train our children to do the same. The most convincing lies are the ones that do the best job of mimicking what is good.<br><br>The American Dream includes providing the best home you can for your children, which in our culture is thought to be the biggest, most comfortable house you can afford. Often, living in a part of town where big houses predominate makes it possible for you to help your kids form friendships among a &#x201c;good&#x201d; group of kids. And it makes it easier to enroll your kids in a &#x201c;good&#x201d; school, where they will benefit from outside activities, get into the right classes, and earn good grades&#x2014;which will set them on the path to the best college. Add it all up and boom! You have the best chance of coming out with the best kid. Our family had all of these going strong, plus we had what we saw as the added bonus of having our kids in church and youth group. It&#x2019;s hard to argue that God would want to interrupt any of this by pulling your family out of such a forward-looking way of life. Would God really want you to pursue a different kind of life?<br><br>What does it mean to change the trajectory of your life when doing so will completely change the lives of your high-school and middle-school-age children? I have yet to come across a parenting book or parenting &#x201c;expert&#x201d; who would encourage radical lifestyle changes, especially during those sensitive years. If anything, from the moment our children are born, we work hard to build the most secure foundation possible. We want them to be well grounded, especially in preparation for the dreaded teenage years. We lie awake at night figuring out how to combat the destructive influences that are sure to attack our children.<br><br>Most parents and even the experts would agree that the absolute worst time to uproot a child is during either middle school or high school. I know parents who turned down significant job promotions during those years because they thought moving would be too traumatic, and risky, for their teenagers. Good parents don&#x2019;t do that to their kids, or so the conventional wisdom goes.<br><br>Not that I worried about such things. Curt and I enjoyed thriving careers in North Carolina, with no thought about moving in order to further our success. Everything was proceeding as planned for our family. Until 2002, that is. That&#x2019;s when God started to confront us with troubling questions about how we were living our lives. At the time it seemed to come out of nowhere. Looking back on it now, though, I can see how things were working together to get our attention.<br><br>When you are satisfied with your life and living up to the expectations that are set for being a good parent, it&#x2019;s easy not to examine your life very closely. But God got our attention, and He didn&#x2019;t give up. So in 2006 we let go of everything that was familiar to us. Before long, Curt and I and our teenagers were living a life that was so different<br>from what any of us had experienced before, we knew nothing would ever be the same.<br><br>It was years in the making, starting with a troubling statement made by a speaker at a conference Curt attended. From that point on, Curt and I began to consider other&nbsp; options, and the changes we started making were step by step, with no indication of all that was in front of us.<br><br>We shifted from being a comfortable, upper-middle-class American family to American Christian immigrants in Muslim Southeast Asia. And it began with just twenty-two words: &#x201c;The two greatest moments of your life are the day you are born and the day you&nbsp; discover why you were born.&#x201d;<br><br>That is what Curt heard Kirbyjon Caldwell, a megachurch pastor from Houston, say at Willow Creek Association&#x2019;s 2002 Global Leadership Summit. It was a &#x201c;wow&#x201d; moment. And when Curt came home and told me about it, I had the same reaction. If those words were true, then we knew something was not quite right with our carefully planned, &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; life.<br><br>Sure, we knew the days we were born, but we didn&#x2019;t have a clue about the reason why we were born. We didn&#x2019;t even know that we needed to know why we had been born.<br><br>Finding the answer was the critical missing piece. If we could discover the reason we had been born, it would make everything else make sense. So we began a quest. We became obsessed with the word purpose. This was around the time that Rick Warren&#x2019;s The Purpose Driven Life was published. &#x201c;Problem solved! We&#x2019;ll read that book and<br>find our purpose, which must be the reason why we were born, and all will be well!&#x201d;<br><br>Or so we thought.</p><h2>French Country Hideaways: Vacationing At Private Chateaus &amp; Manors in Rural France</h2><p>Imagine awakening in a castle.

They were murdered with merciless brutality by their SS guards, by army and police units, and often by gangs of civilians as they passed through German and Austrian towns and villages. Even in the bloody annals of the Nazi regime, this final death blow was unique in character and scope.</p><p> </p><p> In this first comprehensive attempt to answer the questions raised by this final murderous rampage, the author draws on the testimonies of victims, perpetrators, and bystanders. Hunting through archives throughout the world, <b>Daniel Blatman</b> sets out to explain&#x2014;to the extent that is possible&#x2014;the effort invested by mankind&#x2019;s most lethal regime in liquidating the remnants of the enemies of the &#x201c;Aryan race&#x201d; before it abandoned the stage of history. What were the characteristics of this last Nazi genocide? How was it linked to the earlier stages, the slaughter of millions in concentration camps? How did the prevailing chaos help to create the conditions that made the final murderous rampage possible? </p><p> </p><p> In its exploration of a topic nearly neglected in the current history of the Shoah, this book offers unusual insight into the workings, and the unraveling, of the Nazi regime. It combines micro-historical accounts of representative massacres with an overall analysis of the collapse of the Third Reich, helping us to understand a seemingly inexplicable chapter in history.</p></p><p>Daniel Blatman is the Max and Rita Haber Professor of Contemporary Jewry at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.This outstanding book is the first comprehensive, systematic study of the final phase of the murderous regime implemented by the Third Reich. Blatman provides heartrending descriptions of the cruelties experienced by the evacuees and of the strategies they employed to cope with the lethal conditions of the forced marches. He also offers the best summary available of the system of concentration and labor camps and the relation of that system to the mass murder of European Jewry. (David Engel, author of <i>In the Shadow of Auschwitz</i>)<br><br>A strikingly original work that breaks important new ground on the murderous evacuations, at the end of the Second World War, of more than a quarter of a million prisoners westward from concentration camps and elsewhere in the east. Blatman not only provides an overlooked history of these slaughters, he shows how the gruesome deportations involved not just Jews, but many other groups. Surveying this horrific history, he proposes new answers to questions about the place of these killings in the history of Nazi criminality and wartime German society. This book amplifies our understanding of the Holocaust and illuminates the disintegration of the Third Reich. (Michael R. Marrus, author of <i>Some Measure of Justice</i>)<br><br>It's hard to come up with a new historical thesis about the Holocaust or Nazism, fields of study that are already jam-packed with researchers. But groundbreaking studies do appear every now and then, studies that offer a different interpretation of familiar historical events and can change the way we understand history. Daniel Blatman's <i>The Death Marches</i> is such a work...Daniel Blatman's book is monumental, not only because of its breadth but also because of the enormous variety of sources it relies on, collected by the author from more than 20 archives in six European countries and the United States. It is a masterpiece of historical work, its power stemming not only from its scope but also from the radical insights it offers on its subject. (Boaz Neumann <i>Haaretz</i> 2010-10-08)<br><br>Blatman's searing account of the last days of the Holocaust focuses on the forced marches designed to keep prisoners of the Nazi regime from liberation by the Allies...In this litany of horror, Blatman describes the evil that bland bureaucrats can generate. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Blatman's assertion, not shared by all historians, that the death marches must be seen as the logical result of Nazi policies helps place the story of concentration camps more firmly into the history of the Holocaust...It's an important read for specialists and students of modern genocide. (Frederic Krome <i>Library Journal</i> 2010-12-01)<br><br>[An] admirable new book...Blatman convincingly demonstrates that the spirit of genocide that Germans had brought with them to Eastern Europe had returned, by the end of the war, to the German heartland itself...Blatman chronicles, authoritatively, an important chapter in the history of Nazi Germany. But because the death marches and associated massacres do not fit our presumptions about genocide, his important book opens again the crucial question of the 20th century: why we kill. (Timothy Snyder <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2011-01-08)<br><br>[An] impressive and comprehensive account of the death marches...One of the many impressive things about this book is the author's determination to offer a rational explanation of the motives that drove so many to participate in this final phase of Nazi genocide. It is one of many ways in which Blatman forces us to reconsider our views of the last phase of the war, the changing dynamics of the Nazi regime, the attitude towards it of ordinary Germans, and indeed the nature and causes of genocide itself. This is a masterly work of lasting value whose importance far transcends that of the research, itself remarkable, that it presents. It is essential reading for anyone concerned with Nazism, the Holocaust, or genocide in general. (Richard J. Evans <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2011-01-20)<br><br>As Nazi control contracted in the last months of World War II, the determination of German soldiers and civil servants to slaughter inmates of the concentration camps did not diminish. This meticulously researched study details the way they kept killing after the war was obviously lost. As Allied, especially Soviet, soldiers advanced into Germany, ideologically motivated murderers were joined by people who believed the starving columns of prisoners stumbling through their communities were a threat that justified wholesale slaughter. This is a significant contribution to the scholarship of genocide, demonstrating how brutes killed to the end and how they were joined by men with no record of racist violence when the Nazi cause was obviously lost. (Stephen Matchett <i>The Australian</i> 2011-03-19)<br><br>[This is] the first comprehensive analysis of this final but no less deadly Nazi assault against Jews and other persecuted and incarcerated groups. Drawing on vast archival materials from across Europe and the testimonies of those who led, those who witnessed, and those who suffered under the marches, Blatman seeks to understand why the Nazis perpetrated these deadly evacuations of prisoners in the waning days of the war, and how they fit into the broader genocidal objectives of the era. Far from seeing the evacuations as merely a tragic footnote in the chaotic last days of the Nazi regime, Blatman argues that the marches constituted their own distinct phase of genocide. In so doing he raises the provocative questions about Nazi ideology, the concentration camp system from which the marches emerged, and the varied means and mechanisms of genocide. (<i>Jewish Book World</i> 2011-04-01)<br><br>Though some historians have treated the "death marches" as the last chapter of the Final Solution, Blatman himself subtitles his book "The final phase of Nazi genocide." One main thrust of this important book is to situate the "death marches" more broadly as the last chapter of the Nazi concentration camp system. One of Blatman's most important contributions is to make historical sense out of an increasingly chaotic situation, to provide structure and order to his narrative of a multifaceted and fragmented phenomenon...Blatman's book allows us to clarify the relationship between the fate of the Jews and the death marches more sharply than before...The Holocaust (understood as the Jewish experience of persecution from 1933 to 1945), the Final Solution (understood as the conscious Nazi attempt to murder every last Jew in their grasp), and the death marches certainly overlapped in terms of Jewish victims' and Nazi perpetrators, but it is the great merit of Daniel Blatman's book--in both its massive empirical base and analytical framework--that these necessary distinctions for historical clarity can now be made.

The people coming together are the reader, me and those the essays are about &#x2014; Rembrandt, Palaeolithic cave painters, a Romanian peasant, ancient Egyptians, an expert in the loneliness of certain hotel bedrooms, dogs at dusk, a man in a radio station. And unexpectedly, our exchanges strengthen each of us in our conviction that what is happening to the world today is wrong, and that what is often said about it is a lie. I&#x2019;ve never written a book with a greater sense of urgency. <br>&#x2014;John Berger</p><p>John Berger was born in London in 1926. His many books include the Booker Prize-winning novel <i>G</i>. and, more recently, <i>To the Wedding</i> and <i>King</i>. Amongst his outstanding studies of art and photography are <i>Another Way of Telling</i>, <i>The Success and Failure of Picasso</i>, and <i>Ways of Seeing</i>. Berger lives in a small village in the French Alps.This volume collects more recent essays that first appeared in a variety of languages in publications in Zurich, Madrid, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Helsinki and London. Since very few readers, even Berger fanatics, will have the linguistic skills to have experienced these texts in their original translated versions, it is useful to have them collected and available here in English. The 24 essays include impressions of artists such as Rembrandt, Degas, Michelangelo, Kahlo and Brancusi. There are the familiar farmyard observations from Berger as the rural dweller in the French Alps. Others, like the one titled "The Chauvet Cave" after a French site of prehistoric art, seem diffuse and free-form rather than focusing on a single subject. On Rembrandt, Berger is in his element, as if speaking about someone he knew personally: "obstinate, dogmatic, cunning, capable of a kind of brutality. Do not let us turn him into a saint." Some of the essays integrate the author's now-shaky memory, as when he writes, "I have the impression, that just after Brancusi's death in 1957, I visited his studio...." And he manages to get off yet another shot against his pet peeve Francis Bacon, in whose art, according to Berger, "pain is watched through a screen, like soiled linen being watched through the round window of a washing machine." Such overstrenuous attacks on a demonstrably major painter are tedious, but most of the present book, integrating the author's own aging and physical decay, rings as true as the rest of his much-appreciated work. (Dec. 28) Forecast: This book is a sure thing for Berger's regular readers and for larger campus art collections.

This catalog is the most comprehensive volume on the artist now available.<br> Jane Livingston's extensively researched biographical essay covers Diebenkorn's entire career and concentrates on the artist's inner life and purposes as revealed in his paintings. Ruth Fine deals primarily with the figurative aspect of Diebenkorn's work (1955-67), and John Elderfield concentrates on the Ocean Park period (1967-93). All three authors provide valuable insights based on their personal relationships with the artist and his widow, Phyllis. On both page and canvas, the reader can sense Diebenkorn's complexity and highly self-conscious working methods, as well as his formidable integrity.<br> <i>The Art of Richard Diebenkorn</i> will give readers with an interest in all phases of modernism new thoughts about the relationship between abstraction and representation. Stunningly illustrated, with 192 full-color reproductions, this book is an exhilarating testament to a distinctive American artist.</p><p>On the process of painting, American painter Richard Diebenkorn once wrote, "I want painting to be difficult to do. The more obstacles, obstructions, problems ... the better." In part, he meant that the freest artistic expression was often the result of some sort of restraint. Much like Shakespeare writing within the rigorous poetic form of the sonnet, Diebenkorn found his format in the vertical, rectangular, human-size canvases that he used to paint his famed Ocean Park series, which occupied a large portion of his magnificent career and included many figurative works. This sequence consists of more than 100 paintings created primarily over the course of the 1970s. There is a tranquil, mystical quality to his works: geometric lines define fields of color evoking the tones, landscape, atmosphere, and quality of light in Ocean Park. His paintings thus hover on the boundary between abstraction and landscape. <p> This paperback exhibition catalog of the retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City contains a beautifully produced plate section, arranged chronologically, that spans nearly the entire second half of the 20th century.

In <i>Nazi Gold</i>, author Tom Bower uncovers the sordid lengths to which Swiss bankers went after the war to protect the plundered wealth hidden in their coffers. Switzerland's excuse for even accepting Nazi gold is a plausible one: in order to maintain their status as a neutral country, they were forced to deal equally with all sides. This does not, however, explain their postwar reluctance to return hundreds of millions of dollars of stolen wealth to central European banks or even to Holocaust victims as a means of restitution.<p> In this well-researched book, Tom Bower revisits the years following the war's end, focusing on the unholy alliance between Swiss bankers and Nazi sympathizers. He leaves no doubt as to the bankers' motives for maintaining secrecy: they were setting a precedent for potential customers in need of safe refuge for other looted fortunes. Finally, he chronicles the United States' overwhelmingly ineffective attempts to force the Swiss to disgorge the Nazi millions. <i>Nazi Gold</i> is certain to raise the hackles of the Swiss banking industry, but Tom Bower has bravely tackled a complicated topic.</p>Nazi Gold is the stunning and shocking expos of the 50-year conspiracy by Swiss bankers to steal deposits by European Jews and help German Nazis hide the money they looted from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. It is also about a group of dedicated Americans with the U.S. Treasury Department -- Sam Klaus, Orvis Schmidt, James Man and Seymour Rubin, to name a few -- who struggled tirelessly for many years following World War II, with little support from the British and French, to get the Swiss to release the deposited funds to the rightful owners or their heirs. Finally, <i>Nazi Gold</i> is about the victims themselves, surviving in a post-war world that showed them little but indifference, prejudice and hate. <p> Based on intensive research and incontrovertible evidence,<i> Nazi Gold</i> is the last dramatic chapter in the history of the Holocaust. Tom Bower, a distinguished British investigative historian, reveals for the first time in full the despicable role played by Swiss banks and the Swiss government in exploiting World War II and the persecution of the Jews to their financial advantage. He describes how Swiss industries manufactured and sold military equipment to the Germans during the war at a substantial profit, and after the war cynically turned away survivors and heirs of victims of the Holocaust with lies, obfuscation and impossible-to-satisfy demands for proof of relationship to deceased depositors.</p><p> Drawing on a wealth of previously unpublished and sensational source material, as well as interviews with many individuals on all sides of the controversy, Bower is also able to re-create important and secret meetings and telephone conversations that are often astounding in the bluntness of their revelations. </p><p></p></p><h2>Norse Mythology</h2><p>Many of the stories from Norse mythology have been handed down through the centuries in the oral tradition and most derive from Iceland.

Here Cahill dares readers to follow him into his world of danger and high-spirited zaniness.</p><p>Travel writing has been popular since Herodotus first jotted down his observations while journeying abroad. Now Tim Cahill adds <i>Pass the Butterworms</i> to the genre, and a welcome addition it is. As in his earlier books <i>Jaguars Ripped My Flesh,</i> <i>A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg,</i> and <i>Pecked to Death by Ducks,</i> Mr. Cahill chronicles his trips to the far-flung corners of the world. Part of this author's charm is his resolute Everyman persona--he is neither remarkably brave nor extraordinarily competent. This is a man, after all, who capsizes his sea kayak in still waters and describes his rock-climbing experience as "hanging from a rope affixed to a diaper, which I am wearing in the place where diapers are most often worn. . . ." <p> Not all of Tim Cahill's essays in <i>Pass the Butterworms</i> are comic, however. Perhaps the most memorable in the collection is "A Darkness on the River," Cahill's account of the senseless murder of a friend's son in Peru and its aftermath. And even his funniest tales have a bittersweet quality to them--the inevitable by-product of an outsider looking in.</p>Cahill (Pecked to Death by Ducks, 1993, etc.) delivers all the goods--vibrancy, wit, intelligence--anyone could hope for from adventure travel writing in this, his fourth, collection. There is not a turkey among these tales (which have appeared in magazines, mostly in Outside). A few of them are snappy little deskside essays--concerning malaria, how to keep Congolese bees from entering your nostrils, a testament to the family values of New Guinea's Dani people. But most concern Cahill's forte, ``remote travel oddly rendered.'' There he sits, curled in the bow of a boat drifting through the unspeakably rotten weather of a Montana spring: ``It was beautiful in a savage and entirely unsettling manner''; or he may detail how sea-kayakers climb the front of monster waves, punch through the crest, and ride a rainbow of spray back to the sea's surface; he concocts a thralling fantasy of landing a small airplane after the pilot's gone and died on you (``when Geraldo Rivera calls to ask you to be on his show, you get to turn him down flat''). And there is a long piece set in Honduras, on a prospecting mission for an eco-tour group, that's all rough edges, a dispatch direct from the field, appealingly jagged, utterly memorable. Cahill's writing gets better all the time, his storytelling style evolving into an art form, his cracking-wiseass humor bevelled by every manner of nuance; waggish he may be, but he's also got a lot of brains. And what more could one ask? He's willing to die for his art. In the end, many of these adventures come down to ``one of those intangible things I'll own forever because I've paid for it, paid for it in equally intangible dues.'' Cold comfort for Cahill, high entertainment for his readers. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Lizzie is intrigued to learn that her predecessor as companion had disappeared, supposedly having run off with an unknown man. But when the girl&#39;s body is found in the rubble of one of the recently demolished slums around the prestigious new railway station at St Pancras, Lizzie begins to wonder exactly what has been going on. She has re-made the acquaintance of a childhood friend, now Inspector Benjamin Ross, and with his help starts to investigate, risking her life to unearth the truth about the death of a girl whose fate seems interlinked with her own.</p><p>Companion<br><i>Chapter One</i><i>Elizabeth Martin</i>&nbsp;<br>THE ENGINE emitted a long sigh rather like an elderly lady loosening her corset and enveloped everything and everyone in a sulphurous pall of smoke and steam. It swirled along the platform and upwards to be trapped beneath the station roof. The smell took me back to Mary Newling's kitchen where, as a small child, I'd been given the task of peeling hard-boiled eggs.At unexpected intervals the smoke veil parted and a figure emerged briefly before disappearing and being replaced with another in a flickering lantern show. Here was a woman with a large bag in one hand and, with the other, towing a small boy in a sailor suit. As they vanished, in another spot appeared a man in jacket and trousers of a loud check pattern with his hat at a rakish angle. I must have appeared to his view as suddenly as he to mine. He gave me a sharp, predatory look and I just had time, before the smoke curtain was drawn over him again, to see the look turn to one of dismissal.'Come along, Lizzie Martin!' I told myself briskly. 'You're neither pretty enough nor well-dressed enough to need worry you'll be troubled.'All the same, it bruised my vanity to be dismissed so quickly.The smoke was thinning rapidly now and the next figure to appear before me wore, to my great relief, the uniform of a porter.A small, wiry man of uncertain age, he grinned at me and tapped his cap in a gesture meant to signal respect, but which unfortunately looked much like the conspiratorial tapping of the brow to suggest simple-mindedness in a third party.'Take your bag, miss?''I've only the one,' I apologised, 'and a hatbox.'But he was already reaching for them and I found myself setting off after him at a fair pace towards the barrier. My ticket was whisked from my hand by the grand-looking official on guard there and my escort and I arrived on the main concourse.'Being met, miss? Or need a cab?'The porter was peering up at me.'Oh, yes, a cab, but--'Too late. 'Follow me, then, miss. I'll take you to the rank.'Mrs Parry had written to me at length, regretting it would not be possible for anyone to meet me but giving detailed instructions as to what I should do on my arrival in the capital. I should entrust my belongings to a porter who must be (the next words were heavily underscored) an employee of the railway company and no other. If I handed over my bags to anyone else, I should not be surprised if I never saw them again. I had obeyed that instruction, at least.I was well on my way to obey the second: to take a cab, selecting one drawn by a horse in good condition, and enquiring first of the driver as to the amount of the fare. I should have him bring me to her address by the most direct route. Cabmen were sometimes impertinent when dealing with single ladies and I must on no account encourage this.A small band of ragged children appeared and ran alongside me, importuning me for pennies.<i>'Go on, gerrahtovit!'</i> roared my porter with unexpected ferocity. As the band scattered, jeering at him, he added to me, 'You want to watch out for them brats! Don't never take out your purse in front of them.''No, indeed not!' I agreed breathlessly. I was a newcomer, clearly from the provinces, but I wasn't stupid and we also had child thieves where I'd come from.A new odour was added to that of smoke, coal ash, grease and unwashed humanity: horses. We had reached a rank of four-wheeled carriages of the type known as 'growlers' from the general racket made by their wheels.'More suitable for a lady on her own,' confided my porter. 'You don't want to go hiring a hansom. Where do you wish to go, miss?' And before I could answer, 'Look sharp, there, Wally! Here's a lady wants a cab.'The cabman in question had been leaning against his horse's rump, engaged in the leisurely eating of a pie. He now pushed the last of the crumbling pastry into his mouth and adopted an alert manner. It didn't make him look any the less alarming. He was stocky and brawny and his features were so battered that it gave the impression he'd collided with a particularly solid object at some point in his life. Alone, I should have hesitated to approach him.He saw my startled expression and addressed me. 'You worried by this squashed mug of mine, miss?' He pointed a stubby finger at his nose which was particularly crooked. 'That comes of my illustrious career in the prize ring that does. Illustrious but brief, mind. It was a woman made me give it up. "Wally Slater," she said. "It's the prize ring or me." Being young and foolish at the time,' he added confidentially, 'I took her and now she's my ever-loving wife and I'm driving this cab for a living!' He fell to chortling and slapping his sides. The horse gave a sardonic snort.'Never mind all that, Wally,' my porter reproached him. Like the horse, he had probably heard this story innumerable times before. 'Where do you want to go, miss?'I gave him the address, Dorset Square, adding, 'It's in Marylebone.''And very nice, too,' observed the cabman, taking my bag from the porter.'How much?' I asked quickly, mindful of my instructions.He squinted at me, which made him look even more frightening, and named his fare. I caught the porter's eye and he gave me an encouraging nod which I took to mean the price was a fair one. Or he might just have been in league with the cabbie. I had no way of knowing. They were obviously old acquaintances.My suspicions were further aroused when the cabbie went on, 'It might turn out sixpence extra, miss, if we have to go the long way round on account of all the carts.''I want to go straight there!' I said sternly.'Nah, you don't understand, miss,' said Mr Slater earnestly. 'They're clearing the site for the new station, see? Pulling down the houses and taking all the rubble away. It's blocking the streets all around and giving us cabbies no end of trouble. Ain't that right?' he appealed to the porter.The latter's head bobbed like a nodding automaton. ''Sright, miss. The Midland Railway is going to get its own terminus, see, instead of sharing others? St Pancras it'll be called. The railway company has bought up all the houses and turned out all the people as lived there, and now they're pulling everything down and making it nice and flat. Why, even the church will have to go.''They're going to build that up again somewhere else, that's what I heard,' said the cabbie.'Are they going to build houses for people to live in somewhere else, that's what I want to know,' countered the porter.'It's the graveyard,' confided the cabbie with lugubrious relish, 'as they reckon will give them trouble. They've tried digging under it by way of an hexperiment, but they keeps finding <i>yooman remains</i>, as I've heard.'They bent their joint gaze upon me to make sure I appreciated this gruesome fact. It was, I fully realised, a means of putting a stop to my objections.'Very well,' I said, attempting to sound businesslike. I pressed a coin into the porter's hand and he gave me another of his peculiar salutes before scurrying away.I just had time before allowing myself to be handed up (or rather, bundled into) the cab, to take a look at the horse. It seemed sound enough to my inexperienced eye, although had it been the most pitiful, overworked, broken-kneed nag on the streets of London, it would have been too late to quibble about it. We were off.I have to admit I was curious to have my first sight of London and peered out as we rumbled and bounced along. I hoped too for a breath of fresher air as the inside of the growler smelled stale and sweaty although it was clean enough. But I soon decided against putting my face through the opened window. The noise was deafening and there was an alarming press of other vehicles around us heading this way and that, the drivers all shouting at one another to give way and watch out. There seemed only a notional respect for the requirement to keep to the left, most preferring to go straight down the middle of the road if they could, often to avoid a slow-moving omnibus drawn by its weary sweating horses. As for the other requirement, that cabs give way to private carriages, that too seemed honoured more in the breach than the observance.All this was to say nothing of pedestrians who put life and limb at risk to dart between unforgiving wheels which at the least spattered them with mud and worse and would have bemired me had I been fool enough to put my head right out. Here and there crossing sweepers did their best to clear a path for the better dressed but most passers-by seemed resigned to the dirt. So I contented myself with observing from within as a bewildering parade of images flickered by, hardly glimpsed before gone.With the pedestrians mingled sellers of every kind of small item from penny news-sheets to ribbons and matches while costermongers had set up stalls or parked barrows from which tosell fruit and vegetables. A strong smell of fish which briefly invaded the cab suggested a woman seated by a large barrel was selling herrings. A more enticing smell came from a stall on which stood two large copper urns dispensing hot coffee.We were passing the site of the new station, apparently. I could see little of it but its existence was represented in the numerous carts laden with debris mingling with the other traffic. A swirl of dust-laden air invaded the growler causing me to cough. I had been warned of the nuisance these carts were causing, but even if I hadn't been, their lack of popularity was clear. Pedestrians expressed vehement frustration and cabmen hurled abuse as the creaking vehicles lumbered slowly along causing queues to form behind them. For my own part, I found these wagons and their loads singularly pathetic. Clinging to the heaps of broken bricks and shattered tiles were scraps of fabric which once had been a window curtain or a cheap carpet; occasionally a broken chair or a mangled piece of iron bedstead perched insecurely atop the lot. The remains of a straggling rose bush bore witness to some inhabitant's desire to have a garden of a sort. Broken planks, door and window frames poked up skeletal fingers, as if they would climb out of their rubble tombs. We jolted abruptly to a halt and I wondered if we'd arrived.Some telepathy was at work, as a small trap window flew open above my head and opposite. Wally Slater's eyes peered through it down at me. 'Just another cart, miss. There's a bobby stopping us to let it through.''Bobby?''Peeler, miss, a hofficer of the law, what has made it his business to take charge. They're very good at doing that, the police, taking charge and interfering in an honest citizen's daily business,' concluded the cabman resentfully.Now I did venture to put my head out of the window to see what was so different about this cart that the law had stepped in to aid its progress. A fresh cloud of dust assailed my nostrils andI sneezed. I was about to pull my head back inside when the new vehicle appeared approaching from a turning to our right. It was another wagon, much like those carrying rubble, but this carried only a single mysterious object covered by a tarpaulin. Unlike the whistling and catcalls which had greeted the other carts, a curious, uneasy silence fell as this one rumbled into view. Nearby an oldish man pulled off his cap.The cab rocked and I saw that my driver had clambered down from his perch and approached a burly man in workman's clothes whom he appeared to know. They began a whispered conversation.'Is it an accident?' I called out.They both turned towards me. The workman opened his mouth but the cabman answered quickly, 'Nothing to worry you, miss.''But it is a dead body they are transporting there, is it not?' I persisted. 'Has there been some kind of fatal accident where they are working at the site of the new terminus?' I remembered then that some of the excavations being carried out involved a graveyard. 'Or is it a coffin from the churchyard?'Walter Slater, ex-prizefighter, was looking at me in a way both shocked and disapproving. Whether he thought me bluntly practical or morbidly fascinated, either way it wasn't in his view how respectable young ladies should behave in the face of death. A little more distress was called for. However, I was never one for wailing and fainting. Nevertheless, perhaps he deserved an explanation.'I am a doctor's daughter,' I told him. 'And my father was often called to accidents at the--'Here I broke off. I had been going to say 'at the mines' but this was London, not Derbyshire, and what would these men know of coal mines?So I completed my sentence, 'At the request of the authorities.'The cabbie said, 'Yes, miss, I dare say.' But I saw my lapse of taste was not to be overlooked.Now, Lizzie! I told myself again severely. You must watch your tongue! This is London and provincial frankness probably isn't the done thing. If you scandalise even this cabbie, what dreadful social gaffes do you risk making with the more sensitive class of person?The workman, however, seemed amused by the exchange. 'Bless you, miss,' he said cheerfully. 'This ain't an old one, this is a fresh one.'Slater growled at him to hold his tongue, but as I was already marked down by Wally as a person given to improper interest in the event, I might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.'What do you mean, a fresh one? It is an accident, then?' I demanded of the workman.'They found a woman's body,' he returned with relish. ''Orribly murdered. She was in one of the 'ouses they're pulling down. They found 'er body hid under an old bedstead as was in there. She'd been there a few weeks, they reckon. She was as green as a cabbage and the rats--'I felt myself blanch as the cabbie snapped, 'That's enough!' and cut short any further unwelcome details.But I think he was well satisfied that the few provided had proved too much even for my composure. He gave me a look which clearly added, 'And serve you right, miss, for showing such an unladylike acquaintance with matters you ought to know nothing of!'My loss of face was saved by the police constable who had been holding back the traffic. 'Come along, there!' he shouted at us.The delay was over. Mr Slater scrambled back on to his perch and whistled to his horse and we went on our way.I settled back, replacing on the seat beside me my hatbox which had fallen to the floor, and tried to put the workman's grisly description from my mind. But in its place came the image of that other body I'd seen carted away in a similar rough and ready fashion, all those years ago. That, of course, had not beenmurder. Or perhaps it depended on how you looked at it. As far as my father was concerned it might as well have been.I forced both memories away, although I couldn't but reflect it was a violent introduction to London. I thought again of the scraps of curtain material fluttering in the breeze atop the bricks and the broken woodwork. Where had all the people gone? I wondered. Those who had lived in the demolished houses? Had they been given any say in their eviction? Probably not. They had been cleared away in the name of the unstoppable progress of the Railway Age and they had left behind something dreadful indeed.British author Granger's picturesque but disappointing Victorian historical alternates point-of-view between independent-minded Elizabeth Martin and young Scotland Yard inspector Benjamin Ross, long-separated childhood friends whose paths coincidentally cross at a murder case. Lizzie, the impoverished daughter of a doctor, finds herself without resources after her father's death in 1864, and moves to London to serve as companion for the wealthy Mrs. Parry. Ross is investigating the brutal murder of a young woman, who turns out to have been Lizzie's employer's previous companion. Outraged that Mrs. Parry and her cronies blame the victim for her fate, Martin does some amateur sleuthing on her own, but the resolution turns on her endangerment&#x2014;not her powers of deduction. Granger, the author of the long-running Fran Vardy cozy series and the Mitchell and Markby series, delivers persuasive period detail but commonplace plot and characters. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Resilience discourse incites noisy damage, like screams, so that it can be recycled for a profit. It turns the crises posed by avant-garde noise, feminist critique, and black aesthetics into opportunities for strengthening the vitality of multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy (MRWaSP). Reading contemporary pop music &#x2013; Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Calvin Harris &#x2013; with and against political philosophers like Michel Foucault, feminists like Patricia Hill Collins, and media theorists like Steven Shaviro, /Resilience &amp; Melancholy/ shows how resilience discourse manifests in both pop music and in feminist politics. In particular, it argues that resilient femininity is a post-feminist strategy for producing post-race white supremacy. Resilience discourse allows women to &#x201c;Lean In&#x201d; to MRWaSP privilege because their overcoming and leaning-in actively produce blackness as exception, as pathology, as death. The book also considers alternatives to resilience found in the work of Beyonce, Rihanna, and Atari Teenage Riot. Updating Freud, James calls these pathological, diseased iterations of resilience &#x201c;melancholy.&#x201d; Melancholy makes resilience unprofitable, that is, incapable of generating enough surplus value to keep MRWaSP capitalism healthy. Investing in the things that resilience discourse renders exceptional, melancholic siren songs like Rihanna&#x2019;s &#x201c;Diamonds&#x201d; steer us off course, away from resilient &#x201c;life&#x201d; and into the death.</p><p>Robin James is Associate Professor of Philosophy at UNC Charlotte, a contributor to Cyborgology and The New Inquiry, and a sound artist.

They live in isolation in an old boat in the desert. As they age their relationship shifts from mother and son, to brother and sister and eventually lovers. In the meantime however Dodola is forced to prostitute herself to desert traders in order to provide for Zam. When he seeks an alternative means of income Dodola is captured by the Sultan and Zam is forced into a quest to try and rescue her. At heart Habibi is, like Blankets, a profound love story, but it also functions as a parable about the environment and the state of the world. Set in the place where Christianity and Islam began, it explores the fundamental connection between these religions, and also the relationship between the first and the third world and the increasingly important battle for the earth&#39;s resources. Ambitious, but always deeply felt, &#34;Habibi&#34; is a beautifully drawn and moving graphic novel that will get a huge amount of attention.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2011</strong>: <i>Habibi</i> is impressive to hold. It looks like a lost tome, recovered from a different time and place--a fitting package for a comic book that feels like an exotic, bizarre fairy tale. Craig Thompson's inkwork is bold yet intricate. Each page reveals a meticulous symmetry, both in art and narrative, that unravels a sweeping tale that takes readers from the dessert to an industrial wasteland to the inner walls of a harem. Thematically, there's no shortage of ambition here, as Thompson tackles familial and romantic love, one's relationship to their environment, the shared roots of Christianity and Islam, and the effects of industrial modernization. Not all of these conflicts are resolved--in fact, there's more ambiguity than there is clarity--but it's Dodola and Zam, the book's two orphaned lovers, that imbue <i>Habibi</i> with empathy and humanity. Thompson, who is best known for <i>Blankets</i>, one of the most critically lauded comics of the past decade, has crafted another affecting story of passion, humor, and imagination. <i>--Kevin Nguyen</i></p>Craig Thompson&#39;s previous graphic novels include Goodbye, Chunky Rice, Blankets, Carnet de Voyage and, most recently, Habibi, an Observer Graphic Novel of the Month and a New York Times bestseller, which was described by Neel Mukherjee as &#39;a landmark publication&#39;.

It is our souls that are the source of all meaning, and the locus of all our suffering, our joy, our glory and shame. But this idea of immaterial souls, capable of defying the laws of physics, has outlived its credibility thanks to the advance of the natural sciences.

I asked him if he had been required to tell them about the conflict between the USA and the USSR. Not at all, he replied. There would have been no point in it. They had never heard of either America or the Soviet Union. In fact, they had never even heard of Brazil! It was still possible in the 1960s for a human being to live in a nation, and be subject to its laws, without the slightest knowledge of that fact. If we find this astonishing, it is because we human beings, unlike all other species on the planet, are knowers. We are the only ones who have figured out what we are, and where we are, in this great universe. And we're even beginning to figure out how we got here.</p><p>These quite recent discoveries about who we are and how we got here are unnerving, to say the least. What you are is an assemblage of roughly a hundred trillion cells, of thousands of different sorts. The bulk of these cells are "daughters" of the egg cell and sperm cell whose union started you, but they are actually outnumbered by the trillions of bacterial hitchhikers from thousands of different lineages stowed away in your body (Hooper et al. 1998). Each of your host cells is a mindless mechanism, a largely autonomous micro-robot. It is no more conscious than your bacterial guests are. Not a single one of the cells that compose you knows who you are, or cares.</p><p>Each trillion-robot team is gathered together in a breathtakingly efficient regime that has no dictator but manages to keep itself organized to repel outsiders, banish the weak, enforce iron rules of discipline&#x2014;and serve as the headquarters of one conscious self, one mind. These communities of cells are fascistic in the extreme, but your interests and values have little or nothing to do with the limited goals of the cells that compose you&#x2014;fortunately. Some people are gentle and generous, others are ruthless; some are pornographers and others devote their lives to the service of God. It has been tempting over the ages to imagine that these striking differences must be due to the special features of some extra thing (a soul) installed somehow in the bodily headquarters. We now know that tempting as this idea still is, it is not supported in the slightest by anything we have learned about our biology in general and our brains in particular. The more we learn about how we have evolved, and how our brains work, the more certain we are becoming that there is no such extra ingredient. We are each made of mindless robots and nothing else, no non-physical, non-robotic ingredients at all. The differences among people are all due to the way their particular robotic teams are put together, over a lifetime of growth and experience. The difference between speaking French and speaking Chinese is a difference in the organization of the working parts, and so are all the other differences of knowledge and personality.</p><p>Since I am conscious and you are conscious, we must have conscious selves that are somehow composed of these strange little parts. How can this be? To see how such an extraordinary composition job could be accomplished, we need to look at the history of the design processes that did all the work, the evolution of human consciousness. We also need to see how these souls made of cellular robots actually do endow us with the important powers and resultant obligations that traditional immaterial souls were supposed to endow us with (by unspecified magic). Trading in a supernatural soul for a natural soul&#x2014; is this a good bargain? What do we give up and what do we gain? People jump to fearful conclusions about this that are hugely mistaken. I propose to prove this by tracing the growth of freedom on our planet from its earliest beginnings at the dawn of life. What kinds of freedom? Different kinds will emerge as the story unfolds.</p><p>Four and a half billion years ago, the planet Earth was formed, and it was utterly without life. And so it stayed for perhaps half a billion years, until the first simple life-forms emerged, and then for the next three billion years or so, the planet's oceans teemed with life, but it was all blind and deaf. Simple cells multiplied, engulfing each other, exploiting each other in a thousand ways, but oblivious to the world beyond their membranes. Then finally much larger, more complex cells evolved&#x2014;eukaryotes&#x2014;still clueless and robotic, but with enough internal machinery to begin to specialize. So it continued for a few hundred million more years, the time it took for the algorithms of evolution to stumble upon good ways for these cells and their daughters and granddaughters to band together into multicellular organisms composed of millions, billions, and (eventually) trillions of cells, each doing its particular mechanical routine, but now yoked into specialized service, as part of an eye or an ear or a lung or a kidney. These organisms (not the individual team members composing them) had become long-distance knowers, able to spy supper trying to appear inconspicuous in the middle distance, able to hear danger threatening from afar. But still, even these whole organisms knew not what they were. Their instincts guaranteed that they tried to mate with the right sorts, and flock with the right sorts, but just as those Brazilians didn't know they were Brazilians, no bison has ever known it's a bison.</p><p>In just one species, our species, a new trick evolved: language. It has provided us a broad highway of knowledge-sharing, on every topic. Conversation unites us, in spite of our different languages. We can all know quite a lot about what it is like to be a Vietnamese fisherman or a Bulgarian taxi driver, an eighty-year-old nun or a five-year-old boy blind from birth, a chess master or a prostitute. No matter how different from one another we people are, scattered around the globe, we can explore our differences and communicate about them. No matter how similar to one another bison are, standing shoulder to shoulder in a herd, they cannot know much of anything about their similarities, let alone their differences, because they can't compare notes. They can have similar experiences, side by side, but they really can't share experiences the way we do.</p><p>Even in our species, it has taken thousands of years of communication for us to begin to find the keys to our own identities. It has been only a few hundred years that we've known that we are mammals, and only a few decades that we've understood in considerable detail how we have evolved, along with all other living things, from those simple beginnings. We are outnumbered on this planet by our distant cousins, the ants, and outweighed by yet more distant relatives, the bacteria. Though we are in the minority, our capacity for long-distance knowledge gives us powers that dwarf the powers of all the rest of the life on the planet. Now, for the first time in its billions of years of history, our planet is protected by far-seeing sentinels, able to anticipate danger from the distant future&#x2014;a comet on a collision course, or global warming&#x2014;and devise schemes for doing something about it. The planet has finally grown its own nervous system: us.<br>&nbsp;<br>We may not be up to the job. We may destroy the planet instead of saving it, largely because we are such free-thinking, creative, unruly explorers and adventurers, so unlike the trillions of slavish workers that compose us. Brains are for anticipating the future, so that timely steps can be taken in better directions, but even the smartest of beasts have very limited time horizons, and little if any ability to imagine alternative worlds. We human beings, in contrast, have discovered the mixed blessing of being able to think even about our own deaths and beyond. A huge portion of our energy expenditure over the last ten thousand years has been devoted to assuaging the concerns provoked by this unsettling new vista that we alone have.</p><p>If you burn more calories than you take in, you soon die. If you find some tricks that provide you a surplus of calories, what might you spend them on? You might devote person-centuries of labor to building temples and tombs and sacrificial pyres on which you destroy some of your most precious possessions&#x2014;and even some of your very own children. Why on earth would you want to do that? These strange and awful expenditures give us clues about some of the hidden costs of our heightened powers of imagination. We did not come by our knowledge painlessly.</p><p>Now what will we do with our knowledge? The birth pangs of our discoveries have not subsided. Many are afraid that learning too much about what we are&#x2014;trading in mystery for mechanisms&#x2014;will impoverish our vision of human possibility. This fear is understandable, but if we really were in danger of learning too much, wouldn't those on the cutting edge be showing signs of discomfort? Look around at those who are participating in this quest for further scientific knowledge and eagerly digesting the new discoveries; they are manifestly not short on optimism, moral conviction, engagement in life, commitment to society. In fact, if you want to find anxiety, despair, and anomie among intellectuals today, look to the recently fashionable tribe of post-modernists, who like to claim that modern science is just another in a long line of myths, its institutions and expensive apparatus just the rituals and accoutrements of yet another religion. That intelligent people can take this seriously is a testimony to the power that fearful thinking still has, in spite of our advances in self-knowledge. The postmodernists are right that science is just one of the things we might want to spend our extra calories on. The fact that science has been a major source of the efficiencies that created those extra calories does not entitle it to any particular share of the wealth it has created. But it should still be obvious that the innovations of science&#x2014;not just its microscopes and telescopes and computers, but its commitment to reason and evidence&#x2014;are the new sense organs of our species, enabling us to answer questions, solve mysteries, and anticipate the future in ways no earlier human institutions can approach.</p><p>The more we learn about what we are, the more options we will discern about what to try to become. Americans have long honored the "self-made man," but now that we are actually learning enough to be able to remake ourselves into something new, many flinch. Many would apparently rather bumble around with their eyes closed, trusting in tradition, than look around to see what's about to happen. Yes, it is unnerving; yes, it can be scary. After all, there are entirely new mistakes we are now empowered to make for the first time. But it's the beginning of a great new adventure for our knowing species. And it's much more exciting, as well as safer, if we open our eyes.</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>"); } else { document.write(""); } //--</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>"); } else { document.write(""); } //--</p><p></p><p>One widespread tradition has it that we human beings are responsible agents, captains of our fate, because what we really are are souls, immaterial and immortal clumps of Godstuff that inhabit and control our material bodies rather like spectral puppeteers.

Yet as one observes the Grieben character evolve, one must question whether the ultimate motive is power or a desire to be loved. Author Dalton Trumbo wrote the book with the idea that the charcter was struggling with power from childhood only to despair in his final years. Even then, he decides it was all worth it. In the end, Trumbo makes the reader look at the manipulative side of himself/herself to see our similar ugliness. From the manipulative and perhaps borderline sadistic exploitation of a neighborhood girl to his exploitation of a former interest at Auschwitz despite the potential barriers, it becomes apparent that power and love are closely related for Grieben. Because they are so closely related, his relationships are corrupted. From the first squirrel that he killed, there was a certain sense of detachment. When not involved with females, he chased other sources of power and authority in his military career. It becomes difficult for the reader to decide how to take the main character. Trumbo&#39;s work is clever in that he knows the reader will not readily identify with the character, but can the reader can share common elements with the Grieben. The great tragedy of this book is that Trumbo was never able to finish it. Most editions of the book include letters and notes from Trumbo which give extra hints about the character. The story was unfortunately far too short and left me thirsting for more.</p><p></p><h2>The Lost Scrolls: Air (Avatar)</h2><p><b>IF YOU ARE READING THIS</b>, you have uncovered one of the four hidden scrolls I have compiled about the world of Avatar.

The brightness intruded, grew, made him blink groggily. A window was open, letting in mild afternoon air and a freshwater smell. Not Camorr. Sound of waves lapping against a sand beach. Not Camorr <br>at all.<br>He was tangled in his sheets again, light-headed. The roof of his mouth felt like sun--dried leather. Chapped lips peeled apart as he croaked, &#x201c;What are you&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Shhhh. I didn&#x2019;t mean to wake you. The room needed some air.&#x201d; A dark blur on the left, more or less Jean&#x2019;s height. The floor creaked as the shape moved about. Soft rustle of fabric, snap of a coin purse, clink of metal. Locke pushed himself up on his elbows, prepared for the dizziness. It came on punctually.<br>&#x201c;I was dreaming about her,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;The times that we&nbsp;. . . when we first met.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Her?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Her. You know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah. The canonical her.&#x201d; Jean knelt beside the bed and held out a cup of water, which Locke took in his shaking left hand and sipped at gratefully. The world was slowly coming into focus.<br>&#x201c;So vivid,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;Thought I could touch her. Tell her&nbsp;. . . how sorry I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best you can manage?

I&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be gone long.&#x201d; Jean set the cup on the table and gave the lapels of his coat a perfunctory brushing as he moved to the door. &#x201c;Get some more rest.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t bloody listen to reason, do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know what they say about imitation and flattery.&#x201d;<br>The door slid shut and Jean was gone, out into the streets of La-<br>shain.<br>2<br>Lashain was famous as a city where anything could be bought and anything could be left behind. By the grace of the regio, the city&#x2019;s highest and thinnest order of nobility (where a title that could be traced back more than two generations qualified one for the old guard), just about anyone with cash in hand and enough of a pulse to maintain semiconsciousness could have their blood transmuted to a reasonable facsimile of blue.<br>From every corner of the Therin world they came&#x2014;-merchants and criminals, mercenary captains and pirates, gamblers and adventurers and exiles. As commoners they entered the chrysalis of a countinghouse, shed vast quantities of precious metal, and as newborn peers of Lashain they emerged into daylight. The regio minted demibarons, barons, viscounts, counts, and even the occasional marquis, with styles largely of their own invention. Honors were taken from a list and cost extra; &#x201c;Defender of the Twelvefold Faith&#x201d; was quite popular. There were also half a dozen meaningless orders of knighthood that looked marvelous on a coat lapel.<br>Because of the novelty of this purchased respectability to those who brokered it for themselves, Lashain was the most violently manners--conscious city Jean Tannen had ever visited. Lacking centuries of aristocratic descent to assure them of their worth, the neophytes of Lashain overcompensated with ceremony. Their rules of precedence were like alchemical formulae, and dinner parties killed more of them each year than fevers and accidents combined. It seemed that little could be more thrilling for those who&#x2019;d just bought their family names than to risk them (not to mention their mortal flesh) over minor insults.<br>The record, as far as Jean had heard, was three days from counting--house to dueling green to funeral cart. The regio, of course, offered no refunds to relations of the deceased.<br>As a result of this nonsense, it was difficult for those without titles, regardless of the color of their coin, to gain ready access to the city&#x2019;s best physikers. They were made such status symbols by their noble clients that they rarely had to scamper after gold from other sources.<br>The taste of autumn was in the cool wind blowing off the Amathel, the Lake of Jewels&#x2014;-the freshwater sea that rolled to the horizon north of Lashain. Jean was conservatively dressed by local standards, in a brown velvet frock coat and silks worth no more than, say, three months&#x2019; wages for an average tradesman. This marked him instantly as someone&#x2019;s man and suited his current task. No gentleman of consequence did his own waiting at a physiker&#x2019;s garden gate.<br>Scholar Erkemar Zodesti was regarded as the finest physiker in Lashain, a prodigy with the bone saw and the alchemist&#x2019;s crucible. He&#x2019;d also shown complete disinterest, for three days straight, in Jean&#x2019;s requests for a consultation.<br>Today Jean once again approached the iron--barred gate at the rear of Zodesti&#x2019;s garden, from behind which an elderly servant peered at him with reptilian insolence. In Jean&#x2019;s outstretched hand was a parchment envelope and a square of white card, just like the three days previous. Jean was getting testy.<br>The servant reached between the bars without a word and took everything Jean offered. The envelope, containing the customary gratuity of (far too many) silver coins, vanished into the servant&#x2019;s coat. The old man read or pretended to read the white card, raised his eyebrows at Jean, and walked away.<br>The card said exactly what it always did&#x2014;-Contempla va cora frata eminenza. &#x201c;Consider the request of an eminent friend,&#x201d; in the Throne Therin that was the polite affectation for this sort of gesture. Rather than giving an aristocrat&#x2019;s name, this message meant that someone powerful wished to pay anonymously to have someone else examined. This was a common means of bringing wealth to bear on the problem of, say, a pregnant mistress, without directly compromising the identity of anyone important.<br>Jean passed the long minutes of his wait by examining the physiker&#x2019;s house. It was a good solid place, about the size of a smaller Alcegrante mansion back in Camorr. Newer, though, and done up in a mock Tal Verrar style that labored to proclaim the importance of its inhabitants. The roof was tiled with slats of volcanic glass, and the windows bordered with decorative carvings that would have better suited a temple.<br>From the heart of the garden itself, closed off from view by a ten--foot stone wall, Jean could hear the sounds of a lively party. Clinking glasses, shrieks of laughter, and behind it all the hum of a nine--stringed viol and a few other instruments.<br>&#x201c;I regret to inform your master that the scholar is presently unable to accommodate his request for a consultation.&#x201d; The servant reappeared behind the iron gate with empty hands. The envelope, a token of earnestness, was of course gone. Whether into the hands of Zodesti or this servant, Jean couldn&#x2019;t say.<br>&#x201c;Perhaps you might tell me when it would be more convenient for the scholar to receive my master&#x2019;s petition,&#x201d; said Jean, &#x201c;the middle of the afternoon for half a week now being obviously unsuitable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t say.&#x201d; The servant yawned. &#x201c;The scholar is consumed with work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With work.&#x201d; Jean fumed as the sound of applause drifted from the garden party. &#x201c;Indeed. My master has a case which requires the greatest possible skill and discretion&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your master could rely upon the scholar&#x2019;s discretion at all times,&#x201d; said the servant. &#x201c;Unfortunately, his skill is urgently required elsewhere at the moment.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gods damn you, man!&#x201d; Jean&#x2019;s self--control evaporated. &#x201c;This is important!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will not be spoken to in a vulgar fashion. Good day.&#x201d;<br>Jean considered reaching through the iron bars and seizing the old man by the throat, but that would have been counter-productive. He wore no fighting leathers under his finery, and his decorative shoes would be worse than bare feet in a scuffle. Despite the pair of hatchets tucked away under his coat, he wasn&#x2019;t equipped to storm even a garden party by choice.<br>&#x201c;The scholar risks giving offense to a citizen of considerable importance,&#x201d; growled Jean.<br>&#x201c;The scholar is giving offense, you simple fellow.&#x201d; The old man chuckled. &#x201c;I tell you plainly, he has little interest in the sort of business arranged in this fashion. I don&#x2019;t believe a single citizen of quality is so unfamiliar with the scholar that they need fear to be received by the front door.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call again tomorrow,&#x201d; said Jean, straining to keep his composure. &#x201c;Perhaps I might name a sum that will penetrate even your master&#x2019;s indifference.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are to be commended for your persistence, if not for your perception. Tomorrow you must do as your master bids. For now, I have already said good day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good day,&#x201d; growled Jean. &#x201c;May the gods cherish the house wherein such kindness dwells.&#x201d; He bowed stiffly and left.<br>There was nothing else to be done at the moment, in this gods--damned city where even throwing envelopes of coins was no guarantee of attracting attention to a problem.<br>As he stomped back to his hired carriage, Jean cursed Maxilan Stragos for the thousandth time. The bastard had lied about so much. Why, in the end, had the damned poison been the one thing he&#x2019;d chosen to tell the truth about?<br>3<br>Home for the time being was a rented suite in the Villa Suvela, an unadorned but scrupulously clean rooming house favored by travelers who came to Lashain to take the waters of the Amathel. Those waters were said to cure rheumatism, though Jean had yet to see a bather emerge leaping and dancing. The rooming house overlooked a black sand beach on the city&#x2019;s northeast shore, and the other lodgers kept to themselves.<br>&#x201c;The bastard,&#x201d; said Jean as he threw open the door to the suite&#x2019;s inner apartment. &#x201c;The motherless Lashani reptile. The greedy son of a piss--bucket and a bad fart.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My keen grasp of subtle nuance tells me you might be frustrated,&#x201d; said Locke. He was sitting up, and he looked fully awake.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been snobbed off again,&#x201d; said Jean, frowning. Despite the fresh air from the window the inner apartment still smelled of old sweat and fresh blood. &#x201c;Zodesti won&#x2019;t come. Not today, at least.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To hell with him, then, Jean.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the only physiker of repute I haven&#x2019;t got to yet. Some of the others were difficult, but he&#x2019;s being impossible.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been pinched and bled by every gods--damned lunatic in this city who ever shoved a bolus down a throat,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;One more hardly signifies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d; Jean flung his coat over a chair, set his hatchets down, and removed a bottle of blue wine from a cabinet. &#x201c;An alchemical expert. A real smirking rat--fucker, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all for the good, then,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;What would the neighbors say if I consulted a man who screws rodents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We need his opinion.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of being a medical curiosity,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;If he won&#x2019;t come, he won&#x2019;t come.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call again tomorrow.&#x201d; Jean poured two half--glasses of wine and watered them until they were a pleasant afternoon--sky color. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have the self--important prick here one way or another.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What would you do, break his fingers if he won&#x2019;t consult? Might make things ticklish for me. Especially if he wants to cut something off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He might find a solution.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, for the gods&#x2019; sake.&#x201d; Locke&#x2019;s frustrated sigh turned into a cough. &#x201c;There is no solution.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Trust me. Tomorrow is going to be one of my unusually persuasive days.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As I see it, it&#x2019;s cost us only a few pieces of gold to discover how unfashionable we are. Most social failures incur far greater expense, I should think.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somewhere out there,&#x201d; said Jean, &#x201c;must be an illness that makes its sufferers meek, mild, and agreeable. I&#x2019;ll find it someday, and see that you get the worst possible case.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I was born immune. Speaking of agreeable, will that wine be arriving in my hands any time this year?&#x201d;<br>Locke had seemed alert enough, but his voice was slurring, and weaker than it had been even the day before. Jean approached the bed uneasily, wineglasses held out like a peace offering to some unfamiliar and potentially dangerous creature.<br>Locke had been in this condition before, too thin and too pale, with weeks of beard on his cheeks. Only this time there was no obvious wound to tend, no cuts to bandage. Just Maxilan Stragos&#x2019; insidious legacy doing its silent work. Locke&#x2019;s sheets were spotted with blood and with the dark stains of fever--sweat. His eyes gleamed in bruised sockets.<br>Jean pored over a pile of medical texts each night, and still he didn&#x2019;t have adequate words for what was happening to Locke. He was being unknit from the inside; his veins and sinews were coming apart. Blood seeped out of him as though by some demonic whim. One hour he might cough it up, the next it would come from his eyes or nose.<br>&#x201c;Gods damn it,&#x201d; Jean whispered as Locke reached for the wineglass. Locke&#x2019;s left hand was red with blood, as though his fingers had been dipped in it. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing unusual.&#x201d; Locke chuckled. &#x201c;It started up while you were gone&nbsp;. . . from under my nails. Here, I can hold the glass with my other one&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Were you trying to hide it from me? Who else changes your gods--damned sheets?&#x201d;<br>Jean set the glasses down and moved to the table beneath the window, which held stacks of linen towels, a water jug, and a washing bowl. The bowl&#x2019;s water was rusty with old blood.<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t hurt, Jean,&#x201d; muttered Locke.<br>Ignoring him, Jean picked up the bowl. The window overlooked the villa&#x2019;s interior courtyard, which was fortunately deserted. Jean heaved the old bloody water out the window, refilled the bowl from the jug, and dipped a linen cloth into it.<br>&#x201c;Hand,&#x201d; said Jean. Locke sulkily complied, and Jean molded the wet cloth around his fingers. It turned pink. &#x201c;Keep it elevated for a while.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it looks bad, but it&#x2019;s really not that much blood.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve little left to lose!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m also in want of wine.&#x201d;<br>Jean fetched their glasses again and carefully placed one in Locke&#x2019;s right hand. Locke&#x2019;s shakes didn&#x2019;t seem too bad for the moment, which was pleasing. He&#x2019;d had difficulty holding things lately.<br>&#x201c;A toast,&#x201d; said Locke. &#x201c;To alchemists. May they all be stricken with the screaming fire--shits.&#x201d; He sipped his wine. &#x201c;Or strangled in bed. Whatever&#x2019;s most convenient. I&#x2019;m not picky.&#x201d;<br>At his next sip, he coughed, and a ruby--colored droplet spiraled down into his wine, leaving a purplish tail as it dissolved.<br>&#x201c;Gods,&#x201d; said Jean. He gulped the rest of his own wine and set the glass aside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going out to fetch Malcor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jean, I don&#x2019;t need another damned dog--leech at the moment. He&#x2019;s been here six or seven times already. Why&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Something might have changed. Something might be different.&#x201d; Jean grabbed his coat. &#x201c;Maybe he can help the bleeding. Maybe he&#x2019;ll finally find some clue&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There is no clue, Jean. There&#x2019;s no antidote that&#x2019;s going to spring from Malcor or Kepira or Zodesti or any boil--lancing fraud in this whole tedious shitsack of a cit...</p><h2>Dead Hot Mama</h2><p>It&#39;s ice-fishing season in Loon Lake and Doc Osborne is thoroughly hooked.

Most days I&#39;m the first one to see the Admiss</p><p>An international bestseller, Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest defined the 1960s era of ever-widening perspectives and ominous repressive forces. Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p>Ken Kesey (1935-2001) was raised in Oregon, graduated from the University of Oregon, and later studied at Stanford University.

His prolific career spans over one hundred books, including four bestselling series and dozens of short stories and articles.

Block currently lives in New York City with his wife, Lynne.</p>Before Matt Scudder, before Bernie Rhodenbarr, before being named a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Lawrence Block turned out paperback originals. This one--unavailable for more than 40 years--now receives a timely reissue from Hard Case Crime. It's a doozy. Bill Maynard is a card mechanic (cheater) who took a beating in Chicago and now is in serious need of some dental work. He finds it in an unnamed burg on the road to New York, and he also finds a nice little poker game. But who wanders into the game but one of the player's wives--who just happens to know a mechanic when she sees one. Soon enough Maynard and the wife are plotting to skip town with the husband's money, but, of course, the plan goes awry--in part because the square's life starts to feel good to our card shark. Block unwinds his plot superbly, pointing toward a classic noir finale but then seeming to pull away--or maybe not. And, along the way, there is all the teasing sexuality and tongue-in-cheek noir style that a pulp devotee craves. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They are wide ranging and inventive: A young Jewish man's inexplicable transformation into a very large, blond, tattooed goy ends with a Talmudic argument over whether or not his father can beat his unclean son with a copy of the Talmud. A pious man having a near-death experience discovers that God is actually a chicken, and he's forced to reconsider his life -- and his diet. At God's insistence, Leo Schwartzman searches Home Depot for supplies for an ark. And a young boy mistakes Holocaust Remembrance Day as emergency preparedness training for the future. </p><p> Auslander draws upon his upbringing in an Orthodox Jewish community in New York State to craft stories that are filled with shame, sex, God, and death, but also manage to be wickedly funny and poignant.</p></p><p><b>Shalom Auslander</b> was raised as an Orthodox Jew in Spring Valley, New York. Nominated for the Koret Award for writers under thirty-five, he has published articles in <i>Esquire</i> and has had stories aired on NPR's <i>This American Life.</i> He lives in New York City.<b>The War of the Bernsteins</b> <p> These are the things that Bernstein carried in the brown, broken suitcase he kept under his bed in the hope that the Messiah would arrive in the middle of the night: two pairs of black socks, one pair of black pants, a white shirt, one Book of Psalms, some rugalach, three yarmulkes, a spare set of phylacteries, two prayer shawls (one for weekdays, one for Sabbath) and a bathing suit because you never know. </p><p> "In the World to Come," the rabbis would say to Bernstein, "there will be eternal happiness and joy." </p><p> "In the World to Come," Bernstein would say to his wife, "there will be eternal happiness and joy." </p><p> "I'm sorry you're so miserable here," Mrs. Bernstein replied from her post before the kitchen sink. </p><p> Bernstein lived every moment of this life in hopeful preparation for the next. Forty-five years of Torah study had convinced him not only of the sordidness of this world, but of the perfection and euphoria of the World to Come. As he got older, and that world steadily approached, Bernstein became ever more careful. Just last month, he had celebrated his fiftieth birthday. </p><p> "You're halfway to dead!" joked the birthday card Mrs. Bernstein had left for him. Mrs. Bernstein had a suitcase under her bed, too, but it wasn't packed for the Messiah. </p><p> Bernstein decided that with half his life already over, he was running out of time to score points. From now on, every action he took and every deed he considered would be put through a thorough cost/benefit analysis of reward versus punishment. </p><p> If he found himself to be too tired for morning services, he would remind himself of just how many rewards he'd receive in the World to Come if he could only get out of bed. He measured the lure of a one-time bacon double cheeseburger against the everlasting joy of love and peace. He weighed sitting in a buddy booth at the Show World Peep Center with an erection in his hand against sitting among the holy forefathers in the Garden of Eden with a crown of eternal love on his head. </p><p> The spiritual mathematics consumed him. </p><p> Was obeying a negative prohibition worth the same amount of reward in the World to Come as fulfilling a positive commandment? Would the inaction of negative prohibitions really be as rewarded as the deliberate action of positive commandments? If they were, could Bernstein simply not do those things that were negatively prohibited in this world and still be rewarded handsomely in the next, rather than actively doing those things that were positively commanded only to receive pretty much the same reward in the World to Come as if he had simply not done that which had been negatively prohibited? Would he actually be rewarded for not doing something, or would he just not receive the punishment he would have received if he had violated the negative prohibition? Then again, if the commandment was positive and he would receive punishment for not doing it, then would he receive rewards for doing it? Or was it just the not doing it that God was concerned with? </p><p> It gave Bernstein a terrible headache. </p><p> Mrs. Bernstein was only thirty-four years old last May, and was thus far more concerned with her lot in this world than with her lot in what was, in her own estimation, a decidedly dubious next. </p><p> "Let's go to the movies," Mrs. Bernstein said one boring Sunday afternoon. </p><p> Bernstein thought of all the cursing and immorality and nudity he might witness on the big screen, and how much euphoria in the World to Come it would cost him. <i>Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one.</i> </p><p> "Nah," said Bernstein. </p><p> He briefly wondered if by renting <i>The Ten Commandments</i> he could be said to have fulfilled the commandment to <i>fill your heart and mind with Torah all the day and all the night.</i> </p><p> "Well, if we're staying home anyway," Mrs. Bernstein said, "let's make love." She grabbed him playfully around his waist. "Right here," she said, "in the kitchen!" Bernstein thought about how many rules of modesty that would cause him to violate, and how much ecstasy in the World to Come it could possibly cost him. <i>And the Lord said, because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous.</i> </p><p> "I'm tired," Bernstein said. </p><p> Mrs. Bernstein decided that if Bernstein thought she was going to waste her life securing his front-row seat in the afterlife, he had another thing coming. And it wasn't euphoria. </p><p> She decided to fight blessings with curses, piety with profanity. For every commandment, there was a prohibition. For every reward, there was a punishment. For every <i>mitzvah,</i> there was an equal and opposite <i>aveyrah.</i> </p><p> She bought a red silk nightie at Victoria's Secret and wore it casually around the house. She would cause him two sinful thoughts for every pious one in his thoughtless little head. </p><p> She bought jeans. </p><p> <i>He spilled his semen on the ground....What he did was wicked in the Lord's sight, so He put him to death.</i> </p><p> The spiritual mathematics consumed her. </p><p> On the outside chance that there actually was a World to Come, she certainly didn't want to sacrifice her own rewards in the next life just to ruin his. Mrs. Bernstein didn't mind going to the Seventh Level of Hell, so long as she could walk to the edge, look down below and see Mr. Bernstein burning in the Eighth. </p><p> Sin selection became critical: she had to make sure that nothing she was doing to cause him to sin was actually costing her more points than his resultant sin would end up costing him -- committing murder, for instance, just to get him to turn on the light on Shabbos. A felony, if you will, just to cause a misdemeanor. But what if the punishment for causing a sin was not only the punishment for the sin of causing someone to sin, but was also the punishment for the sin of whatever sin she caused? That is, would conspiracy to cause masturbation see her charged with both conspiracy and masturbation? Of course, if the total punishment of causing a sin is a sin of causation plus the sin of the sin that is being caused, then shouldn't causing a commandment to be fulfilled result in both the reward for the commandment of causing a positive commandment to be fulfilled plus the reward for the positive commandment she was causing to be fulfilled? </p><p> It gave her a terrible headache. </p><p> Bernstein began attending prayer services more frequently, praying more fervently, believing more believingly. </p><p> Fearing more fearfully. </p><p> He walked the mile and a half to synagogue for every Friday night service, every Saturday morning service, every Saturday afternoon service and every Saturday evening service.

It is the twelfth Tom Thorne mystery by Mark Billingham, and those of us who have been along for the ride from the very beginning will note a bit of a departure here from previous installments. There is no question who the murderer is and who the victim is (for the most part). Instead, the focus is on the why,&#x201d; or the motivation, if you will, for what propels the plot like a quiet, deadly rocket through a good portion of the book, moving readers just a bit closer to the edge of their seats with each passing page. . . .

The story is told by Branwen, cousin and companion to Esseilte, daughter of the High King of Eriu (Ireland). The two young women save the life of a badly wounded harper, later discovered to be Drustan, who had killed Esseilte's beloved uncle and Branwen's father, Morholt, in battle. Drustan seeks Esseilte's hand for his uncle, Marc'h, King of Kernow (Cornwall), an alliance arranged for political reasons. On the way to Cornwall, Esseilte tries to poison Drustan, but the potion they both drink turns out to be a love filtre prepared for Esseilte and Marc'h. Thus the tale is set in motion, with passion and hate binding the lovers together. With Branwen's aid, they are able to deceive Marc'h on the wedding night: Branwen, close in appearance to the queen, sleeps with the king and falls in love with him. For a while Esseilte and Drustan escape detection, but eventually they are caught in cir cumstances that cannot be ignored, leading to the tragic denouement. This is a complex tale, interweaving the political and religious conflicts of the sixth century, when the ancient Druid religion still had a strong hold.

Resonant with antebellum elegance and sometimes turbulent history, the houses of Under Live Oaks act as a touchstone for another time, becoming repositories of rich family traditions for their owners. <br><br>This tenacity to hold on to their history is beautifully demonstrated in the decor of these houses, filled with antiques and personal treasures, decorated in the style that was fashionable 150 years ago and that has not been tampered with since. More than 200 images from acclaimed photographer Peter Woloszynski fill the pages of Under Live Oaks, giving a provocative view into a world many never see&#x2014;a world of faded portraits, shelves of dusty porcelain, dolls lined up in an armchair, family letters, lace fans, invitations to the cotillion, old steamer trunks. These houses were the royal palaces of the age, furnished with the finest objects and fabrics&#x2014;many imported from Europe&#x2014;that the first half of the nineteenth century had to offer. Under Live Oaks offers a remarkably consistent vision of a period, a period that takes its place in the dark history of America and that casts a permanent shadow over its legacy. <br><br>The houses range from an Italianate villa in Columbus, Georgia, to a masterful Greek Revival mansion in Fairvue, Tennessee; from the charming Catalpa in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to the melancholy Winter Place in Montgomery, Alabama. The classic plantation houses of Natchez, Mississippi, compete in beauty with an elegant townhouse in Walterboro, South Carolina, and the historic Sherwood Forest in Charles City, Virginia. All the states of the Deep South are represented. A few of the houses are open to the public; others are unknown and unvisited except by family and friends. Yet all of them stand as witnesses to a bygone era. <br><br>Noted author Caroline Seebohm eloquently casts the stories of the land, the houses, and their owners. She vividly evokes the power of the architecture and interior design of these houses, and through her we hear the owners&#x2019; pride of place and staunch allegiance to their family history. Under Live Oaks is an intimate tour of the Old South, an experience available to only a few and that in the not-too-distant future will be lost forever.</p><p>Caroline Seebohm was born and brought up in England and graduated from Oxford University.

I can still see the blue glimmer of the flowers in the grass; the low house, with deep wings, where the stucco was peeling from the red brick beneath a delicate tracery of Virginia creeper; the seven pyramidal cedars guarding the hooded roof of gray shingles; and the clear afterglow in which the little moon sailed like a ship.<br><br>-Ellen Glasgow, "Whispering Leaves"</i><br><br>Sherwood Forest<br>charles city, virginia<br><br>The history of the great Southern plantations is also the history of the great rivers rolling down the Southern map of the United States. From the Mississippi in the west to the James River in the east, these important waterways fed the wealth of the plantation owners with their efficient trading posts and speed of communication from one side of the country to the other. Sherwood Forest is one of the beneficiaries of these alluvial currents. One of the four so-called James River Plantations, it is steeped in early American history, was home to the tenth president of United States, John Tyler, and has been in the same family for more than 150 years. What sets Sherwood Forest apart, however, is its extraordinary contemporary record of life in the house since before the Civil War, presented in the form of letters and documents belonging to the Tyler family, and now preserved in Virginia museums and libraries.<br><br>The plantation has its origins in a 1616 land grant. Strategically situated thirty-five miles east of Richmond and eighteen miles west of Williamsburg, both important cities in colonial America, Walnut Grove, as it was then called, was a desirable location not only for its fertile soil but also for those interested in a political career. William Henry Harrison, ninth president of the United States, inherited a part of the property that would become Sherwood Forest in 1790, but its full flowering came with the purchase of the house in 1842 (along with sixteen hundred acres) by John Tyler, who, as vice president to Harrison, became the tenth-and first unelected-president when Harrison died after only thirty days in office. (Tyler had grown up only a few miles from Harrison's birthplace.)<br><br>Although conservative in his preference for living close to home, John Tyler was a controversial president, ever ready to vote against his party, the Whigs, when he found his own high principles at odds with the party line. In fact he renamed his house Sherwood Forest in recognition of his Robin Hood-like reputation as a political outlaw. Not the least of his unconventional acts was his marriage at the age of fifty-four in 1844, while still in office, to a twenty-four-year-old woman called Julia Gardiner (of the Gardiners Island Gardiners). His first wife died in 1842, after bestowing on him eight children, and the speed with which he married the second, let alone her age, raised more than a few eyebrows. If Tyler was regarded as a nonconformist, Julia Gardiner soon showed she was a match for her husband and that her youth was no impediment to her independence of spirit or self-confidence. On June 30, 1844, she wrote to her sister, Juliana, "I have commenced my auspicious reign and am in quiet possession of the Presidential Mansion."<br><br>Quiet she may have been in Washington, but her brilliant marriage to Tyler almost entirely shaped the ultimate history of Sherwood Forest. It seems Tyler bought the house with the idea of retiring there after his stormy presidency came to an end in 1845. From 1842 on, he began making renovations, and when Julia first saw the house on her honeymoon in 1844, she wasted no time in bringing her own considerable talents to the project. The house was originally a simple frame house, dating from 1730 (the central three-story section still reflects its age). It is only one room deep, like a very long railroad car. Tyler, evidently energized by his new marriage, added one-story wings to each side of the house, including a covered walkway to connect the kitchen and laundry to the east end and a west wing that became, like that in the White House, his office. He put in a new staircase in the hall. He also installed, no doubt at the instigation of his new and lively dancing partner, a sixty-eight-foot-long ballroom (just the right length for a Virginia reel), which Julia, when she first saw it, decided would be greatly improved by a vaulted ceiling, to make the music sound better. And so it did. Thus the house, with the added ballroom and wings, was elongated to three hundred feet, the longest frame house in America.<br><br>One of the most wonderful aspects of Sherwood Forest is the extensive documentation preserved through the years covering John and Julia Tyler's life together. Julia and her family wrote more than forty thousand letters to each other while she lived on the plantation, all of which survive, revealing a fascinating day-by-day description of her life. She was no shrinking violet when it came to claiming credit for the work on the house. "The head carpenter was amazed at my science and the president acknowledged I understood more about carpentry and architecture than he did and he would leave all arrangements that were to be made entirely to my taste." Julia had some reservations about renovating an old house as opposed to building a new one, but she declared firmly, "It will be the handsomest place in the County and I assure you there are some very fine ones in it."<br><br>Julia made sure that all the best furniture and furnishings were brought in from the United States and abroad. She was a keen shopper, and on her European travels before her marriage she purchased items such as the Italian landscape painting that now hangs in the drawing room. When in the White House, she had asked for an appropriation with which to buy furniture. The Congress offered her a paltry sum, so she went out and bought objects herself, and when President Tyler left office, she took her purchases with her. Some of them can still be seen in the rooms of Sherwood Forest.<br><br>It was not only the house she focused on. Julia was a highly educated, cultivated young woman and was as interested in gardens and landscape design as in the decorative arts. "The grove will be made into a park (twenty-five acres) and stocked with deer," she wrote to her sister in 1844. A year later: "The hyacinths, tulips, violets, cowslips and various other flowers are blooming in our beds, and the peach trees are in full bloom." Julia's mother took a great interest in her daughters' horticultural efforts and promised to send her Andrew Jackson Downing's treatise on landscape design, the most popular book of the time on the subject. John Tyler shared his wife 's interest, asking for two female statues to "preside over the garden" from the south piazza. Land clearing, planting lists, and pruning were frequently mentioned.<br><br>It is clear from their correspondence that John and Julia Tyler enjoyed a blissfully harmonious marriage, despite the age discrepancy. "She is all that I could wish her to be," he wrote, "the most beautiful woman of the age and at the same time the most accomplished." She was equally adoring. "It seemed as if I had stepped into paradise," she said of her honeymoon. Ten years later she observed, "The President is in good health, and cheerful, which is essential to good health. He fiddles away every evening for the little children black and white to dance to on the Piazza and seems to enjoy it as much as the children. I never saw a happier temperament than he possesses." Meanwhile, amid all the redecorating and Virginia reels, she produced for him seven children, bringing his total to fifteen.<br><br>However, as with all such elite families in the South, these happy times were not to last. "The prospects now are that we shall have a war, and a trying one," Tyler wrote to his wife on April 16, 1861. "These are dark times, dearest, and I think only of you and our little ones. . . . I shall vote secession." A year later, he died at the age of seventy-one. Soon there was a lot of fighting along the James River, a critical supply route, and in 1864 Julia, now a young widow with seven children, decided to escape the continuing danger and take the family to New York. Shortly after she left, Sherwood Forest was raided. The Union soldiers were well aware of the wealth hoarded along the banks of the river. A surviving letter, poorly spelled and punctuated, records their bitter feelings. "This whole country is owned by heavy land holders owning from one to twenty thousand acres a poor man cant own any land." This same soldier reported entering President Tyler's house and "took and destroyed lots of stuff. They say he has the nicest kind of a mansion the house furnished in the best of style. They [took] some very nice furniture such as sofas, looking glasses, stands, carpeting, etc, of the very costliest kind and destroyed the pyana [sic] &amp; large looking glasses . . ."<br><br>The house itself remained relatively unscathed. A burn mark on the floor of the hall is one of the few signs of the vandalism that took place.<br><br>Julia Tyler returned with her children to Sherwood Forest in 1867 and over the years continued to visit the plantation while also spending time in New York and Washington. She finally moved to Richmond in 1882, and died there in 1889. John and Julia Tyler's grandson, Harrison Ruffin Tyler, lives here today with his wife and family. This means that the direct genealogical link connecting President Tyler, born in 1790, to his grandson Harrison Tyler, born in 1928, extends nearly three hundred years.<br><br>Harrison Tyler and his wife, Payne, who came from another old Southern family, the Bettises, started restoring the house in the mid-1970s, after it had suffered a certain amount of neglect. Like Julia, her indomitable antecedent, Payne Tyler has made a great contribution to the inte...</p><h2>Coriolanus (The Arden Shakespeare)</h2><p>&#34;The New Penguin Shakespeare&#34; offers a complete edition of the plays and poems.

An African American girl ponders this question as she meanders home, and her thoughts seem to take as many detours as she does on her journey. She begins playfully--"I made a grass mustache, a dandelion beard, and bird nest toupee"--and grows ever more abstract: "I double-dutched with strands of rainbow. Then I fastened the strands to my hair and my toes and became a fiddle that sunbeams played. Then I sang with the oxygen choir." When she reaches home, the girl voices a string of aspirations: "I want to be quiet but not so quiet that nobody can hear me. I also want to be sound, a whole orchestra with two bassoons and an army of cellos. Sometimes I want to be just the triangle, a tinkle that sounds like an itch." Some readers may need to be guided through the kaleidoscope of metaphors that tumble across the pages; considering each image individually may elicit the greatest response. Pinkney's liquid watercolors, more impressionistic here than in A Starlit Somersault Downhill (see review above), also employ a more vibrant palette. Bright yellows, greens and reds suffused with light heighten the dreamlike quality of the text. Both author and illustrator push the limits of their arts; they deliver illusions with the texture of truth. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5-9. This begins with a young girl who is asked by several people what she wants to be. She doesn't have a ready response, but once she has time to think, she comes up with some extraordinary answers. "I want to be big but not so big that a mountain or a mosque or a synagogue seems small. . . . I want to be quiet but not so quiet that nobody can hear me. I also want to be sound, a whole orchestra with two bassoons and an army of cellos." And on a more whimsical note: "I want to be in motion but I want the ants in my pants to sometimes take a vacation." Most of all, "I want to be all the people I know, then I want to know more people so I can be them all. . . . I want to be life doing, doing everything. That's all." The ambitious text at times goes over the top and becomes pretentious in its imagery, but there is much here with which children can identify. All the pulling and pushing of life comes out in Moss' lilting writing, feelings that kids know all too well. Pinkney's lovely watercolor illustrations, featuring the African American narrator with her hair in cornrows, exude a life-affirming vitality and the sense that anything is possible. Use this as a starting point for discussion to get kids talking about what they would like to be. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Dutch Immigrant Memoirs and Related Writings (English and Dutch Edition)</h2><p>For forty years Dutch Immigrant Memoirs and Related Writings has enlightened and stimulated readers interested in the Dutch heritage.

She was standing in a castle. She&#x2019;d sleep in a castle that night. An honest-to-God Irish castle in the heart of the west.</p><p>Some of her ancestors had worked there, probably slept there. Everything she knew verified that her people, on her mother&#x2019;s side in any case, had sprung from this gorgeous part of the world, this magical part of this magical country.</p><p>She&#x2019;d gambled, well, pretty much everything to come here, to find her roots, to&#x2014;she hoped&#x2014;connect with them. And most of all, to finally understand them.</p><p>Burnt bridges, left them smoldering behind her in the hopes of building new ones, stronger ones. Ones that led somewhere she wanted to go.</p><p>She&#x2019;d left her mother mildly annoyed. But then her mother never rose to serious anger, or sorrow, or joy or passion. How difficult had it been to find herself saddled with a daughter who rode emotions like a wild stallion? Her father had just patted her head in his absent way, and wished her luck as casually as he might some passing acquaintance.</p><p>She suspected she&#x2019;d never been any more than that to him. Her paternal grandparents considered the trip a grand adventure, and had given her the very welcome gift of a check.</p><p>She was grateful, even knowing they belonged to the out-of-sight-out-of-mind school and probably wouldn&#x2019;t give her another thought.</p><p>But her maternal grandmother, her treasured Nan, had given her a gift with so many questions.</p><p>She was here in this lovely corner of Mayo, ringed by water, shadowed by ancient trees, to find the answers.</p><p>She should wait until tomorrow, settle in, take a nap as she&#x2019;d barely slept on the flight from Baltimore. At least she should unpack. She had a week in Ashford Castle, a foolish expense on the practical scale. But she wanted, so wanted that connection, that once-in-a-lifetime treat.</p><p>She opened her bags, began to take out clothes.</p><p>She was a woman who&#x2019;d once wished she&#x2019;d grow taller than her scant five three, and curvier than the slim, teenage boy body the fates had granted her. Then she&#x2019;d stopped wishing and compensated by using bright colors in her wardrobe, and wearing high, high heels whenever she could manage it.</p><p>Illusion, Nan would say, was as good as reality.</p><p>She&#x2019;d once wished she could be beautiful, like her mother, but worked with what she had&#x2014;cute. The only time she&#x2019;d seen her mother close to genuinely horrified had been just the week before when Iona had chopped off her long blond hair to a pixie cap.</p><p>Far from used to it herself, she raked her fingers through it. It suited her, didn&#x2019;t it? Didn&#x2019;t it bring out her cheekbones a little?</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter if she regretted the impulse; she&#x2019;d regretted others. Trying new things, taking new risks&#x2014;those were her current goals. No more wait-and-see, the mantra of her parents as long as she could remember. Now was now.</p><p>And with that in mind she thought, the hell with unpacking, the hell with waiting until tomorrow. What if she died in her sleep?</p><p>She dug out boots, a scarf, the new raincoat&#x2014;candy pink&#x2014;she&#x2019;d bought for Ireland. She dragged a pink-and-white-striped cap over her hair, slung her oversized purse on cross-body.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t think, just do, she told herself, and left her warm, pretty room.</p><p>She made a wrong turn almost immediately, but it only gave her time to wander the corridors. She&#x2019;d asked for a room in the oldest section when she&#x2019;d booked, and liked to imagine servants scurrying with fresh rushes, or ladies sitting at their spindles. Or warriors in bloody mail returning from battle.</p><p>She had days to explore the castle, the grounds, the nearby village of Cong, and she meant to make use of all of it.</p><p>But her primary goal remained to seek out and make contact with the Dark Witch.</p><p>When she stepped outside into the whistling wind and drenching rain she told herself it was a perfect day for witches.</p><p>The little map Nan had drawn was in her bag, but she&#x2019;d etched it on her memory. She turned away from the great stone walls, took the path toward the deep woods. Passed winter-quiet gardens, spreads of soaked green. Belatedly she remembered the umbrella in her bag, dragged it out, pushing her way forward into the evocative gloom of the rain-struck woods.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t imagined the trees so big, with their wide, wide trunks, crazily gnarled branches. A storybook wood, she thought, thrilled with it even as the rain splashed over her boots.</p><p>Through its drumming she heard the wind sigh and moan, then the rumble of what must be the river.</p><p>Paths speared, forked, but she kept the map in her head.</p><p>She thought she heard something cry overhead, and for a moment imagined she saw the sweep of wings. Then despite the drumming, the rumbling, the sighs and the moans, everything suddenly seemed still. As the path narrowed, roughened, her heartbeat pounded in her ears, too quick, too loud.</p><p>To the right an upended tree exposed a base taller than a man, wider than her arm span. Vines thick as her wrist tangled together like a wall. She found herself drawn toward them, struck by the urge to pull at them, to fight her way through them to see what lay beyond. The concept of getting lost flitted through her mind, then out again.</p><p>She just wanted to see.</p><p>She took a step forward, then another. She smelled smoke and horses, and both pulled her closer to that tangled wall. Even as she reached out, something burst through. The massive black blur had her stumbling back. She thought, instinctively: Bear!</p><p>Since the umbrella had flown out of her hand, she looked around frantically for a weapon&#x2014;a stick, a rock&#x2014;then saw as it eyed her, the biggest dog ever to stand on four massive paws.</p><p>Not a bear, she thought, but as potentially deadly if he wasn&#x2019;t somebody&#x2019;s cheerful pet.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello . . . doggie.&#x201d;</p><p>He continued to watch her out of eyes more gold than brown. He stepped forward to sniff her, which she hoped wasn&#x2019;t the prelude to taking a good, hard bite. Then let out two cannon-shot barks before loping away.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She bent over from the waist until she caught her breath. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d;</p><p>Exploring would definitely wait for a bright, sunny day. Or at least a brighter, dryer one. She picked up her soaked and muddy umbrella and pressed on.</p><p>She should&#x2019;ve waited on the whole thing, she told herself. Now she was wet and flustered and, she realized, more travel weary than she&#x2019;d expected. She should be napping in her warm hotel bed, snuggled in listening to the rain instead of trudging through it.</p><p>And now&#x2014;perfect&#x2014;fog rolled in, surfing over the ground like waves on the shore. Mists thickened like those vines, and the rain sounded like voices muttering.</p><p>Or there were voices muttering, she thought. In a language she shouldn&#x2019;t understand, but almost did. She quickened her pace, as anxious to get out of the woods as she&#x2019;d been to get into them.</p><p>The cold turned brutal until she saw her breath hazing out. Now the voices sounded in her head: Turn back. Turn back.</p><p>It was stubbornness as much as anxiety that had her pushing ahead until she nearly ran along the slippery path.</p><p>And like the dog, burst into the clear.</p><p>The rain was just the rain, the wind just the wind. The path opened into a road, with a few houses, smoke puffing out of chimneys. And beyond the beauty of the mist-shrouded hills.</p><p>&#x201c;Too much imagination, not enough sleep,&#x201d; she told herself.</p><p>She saw dooryard gardens resting their bright blooms for spring, cars parked on the roadside or in short drives.</p><p>Not far now, according to Nan&#x2019;s map, so she walked along the road, counting houses.</p><p>It sat farther off the road than the others, farther apart as if it needed breathing room. The pretty thatched-roofed cottage with its deep blue walls and bright red door transmitted that same storybook vibe&#x2014;yet a shiny silver Mini sat in the little driveway. The cottage itself jogged into an L, fronted by curved glass. Even in the winter, pots of bright pansies sat on the stoops, their exotic faces turned upward to drink in the rain.</p><p>A sign of aged wood hung above the curve of glass. Its deeply carved letters said:</p><p>The Dark Witch</p><p>&#x201c;I found her.&#x201d; For a moment Iona just stood in the rain, closed her eyes. Every decision she&#x2019;d made in the last six weeks&#x2014;perhaps every one she&#x2019;d made in her life&#x2014;had led to this.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t sure whether to go to the L&#x2014;the workshop, Nan had told her&#x2014;or the cottage entrance. But as she walked closer she saw the gleam of light on the glass. And closer still, the shelves holding bottles full of color&#x2014;bright or soft&#x2014;hanks of hanging herbs. Mortars and pestles, bowls and . . . cauldrons?</p><p>Steam puffed from one on a stove top, and a woman stood at a work counter, grinding something.</p><p>Iona&#x2019;s first thought was how unfair it seemed that some women could look like that even without fussing. The dark hair bundled up, sexily messy, the rosy flush from the work and the steam. The fine bones that said beauty from birth to death, and the deeply sculpted mouth just slightly curved in a contented smile.</p><p>Was it genes or magick? she wondered. But then, for some, one was the same as the other.</p><p>She gathered her courage and, setting her umbrella aside, reached for the door handle.</p><p>She barely touched it when the woman looked up, over. The smile deepened, polite welcome, so Iona opened the door, stepped in.</p><p>And the smile faded. Eyes of smoke gray held so intensely on her face that Iona stopped where she was, just over the threshold.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I . . . I guess I am. I should&#x2019;ve knocked. I&#x2019;m sorry, I . . . God, it smells amazing in here. Rosemary and basil and lavender, and . . . everything. I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;Are you Branna O&#x2019;Dwyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, yes.&#x201d; As she answered, she took a towel from under the counter, crossed to Iona. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re soaked through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry. I&#x2019;m dripping on the floor. I walked over from the castle. From the hotel. I&#x2019;m staying at Ashford Castle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky you, it&#x2019;s a grand place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a dream, at least what I&#x2019;ve seen of it. I just got here. I mean, a couple hours ago, and I wanted to come to see you right away. I came to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sorry for a lot it seems, in such a short time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Iona twisted the towel in her hands. &#x201c;Yeah, it sounds like it. I&#x2019;m Iona. Iona Sheehan. We&#x2019;re cousins. I mean, my grandmother Mary Kate O&#x2019;Connor is cousins with your grandmother Ailish, um . . . Ailish Flannery. So that makes us . . . I get confused if it&#x2019;s fourth or third or whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A cousin&#x2019;s a cousin for all that. Well then, take off those muddy boots, and we&#x2019;ll have some tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks. I know I should&#x2019;ve written or called or something. But I was afraid you&#x2019;d tell me not to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you?&#x201d; Branna murmured as she set the kettle on.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just once I&#x2019;d decided to come, I needed to push through with it.&#x201d; She left her muddy boots by the door, hung her coat on the peg. &#x201c;I always wanted to visit Ireland&#x2014;that roots thing&#x2014;but it was always eventually. Then . . . well, it was now. Right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go have a seat at the table back there, by the fire. It&#x2019;s a cold wind today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God, tell me! I swear it got colder the deeper I went into the woods, then . . . Oh Jesus, it&#x2019;s the bear!&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped as the massive dog lifted his head from his place at the little hearth, and gave her the same steady stare he had in the woods. &#x201c;I mean the dog. I thought he was a bear for a minute when he came bursting through the woods. But he&#x2019;s a really big dog. He&#x2019;s your dog.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s mine, yes, and I&#x2019;m his. He&#x2019;s Kathel, and he won&#x2019;t harm you. Have you a fear of dogs, cousin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. But he&#x2019;s huge. What is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Breeding, you mean. His father is an Irish wolfhound, and his mother a mix of Irish Dane and Scottish deerhound.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He looks fierce and dignified at the same time. Can I pet him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be up to you and him,&#x201d; Branna said as she brought tea and sugar biscuits to the table. She said nothing more as Iona crouched, held out the back of her hand for the dog to sniff, then stroked it gently over his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Kathel. I didn&#x2019;t have time to introduce myself before. You scared the crap out of me.&#x201d;</p><p>She rose, smiled at Branna. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy to meet you, to be here. Everything&#x2019;s been so crazy, and it&#x2019;s all running around in my head. I can hardly believe I&#x2019;m standing here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sit then, and have your tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I barely knew about you,&#x201d; Iona began as she sat, warmed her chilled hands on the cup. &#x201c;I mean, Nan had told me about the cousins. You and your brother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Connor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Connor, and the others who live in Galway or Clare. She wanted to bring me over years ago, but it didn&#x2019;t work out. My parents&#x2014;well, mostly my mother&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t really want it, and she and my father split up, and then, well, you&#x2019;re just bouncing around between them. Then they both remarried, and that was weird because my mother insisted on an annulment. They say how that doesn&#x2019;t really make you a bastard, but it sure feels like it.&#x201d;</p><p>Branna barely lifted her eyebrows. &#x201c;I imagine it does, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then there was school and work, and I was involved with someone for a while. One day I looked at him and thought, why? I mean we didn&#x2019;t have anything for each other but habit and convenience, and people need more, don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say they do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want more, sometime anyway. Mostly, I never felt like I fit. Where I was, something always felt a little skewed, not quite right. Then I started having the dreams&#x2014;or I started remembering them, and I went to visit Nan. Everything she told me should&#x2019;ve sounded crazy. It shouldn&#x2019;t have made sense, but it did. It made everything make sense.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m babbling. I&#x2019;m so nervous.&#x201d; She picked up a cookie, stuffed it in her mouth. &#x201c;These are good. I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be saying you&#x2019;re sorry again. It&#x2019;s coming on pitiful. Tell me about the dreams.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wants to kill me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Or I didn&#x2019;t. Nan says his name is&#x2014;was&#x2014;is Cabhan, and he&#x2019;s a sorcerer. Evil. Centuries ago our ancestor, the first dark witch, destroyed him. Except some part of him survived it. He still wants to kill me. Us. I know that sounds insane.&#x201d;</p><p>Placidly, Branna sipped her tea. &#x201c;Do I look shocked by all this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You look really calm. I wish I could be really calm. And you&#x2019;re beautiful. I always wanted to be beautiful, too. And taller. You&#x2019;re taller. Babbling. Can&#x2019;t stop it.&#x201d;</p><p>Rising, Branna opened a cupboard, took out a bottle of whiskey. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good day for a little whiskey in your tea. So you heard this story about Cabhan and Sorcha, the first dark witch, and decided to come to Ireland to meet me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Basically. I quit my job, I sold my stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You . . .&#x201d; For the first time Branna looked genuinely surprised. &#x201c;You sold your things?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Including twenty-eight pairs...</p></p><h2>Running with the Horses</h2><p>Nina and her father live in a beautiful riding school famous for their Lippizaners--precious, rare performing horses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina loves the horses that her father looks after, but she also loves Zelda, one of the old carriage horses who she sneaks out to see.&nbsp; It's a perfect world for a little girl, although she has to compete with her father's work for his attention.&nbsp; But a war is coming, one that will threaten their lives and the very existence of the school.&nbsp;<br><br>When the city is under attack, Nina and Father are in charge of fleeing with the horses to a safe place across the border, but can they pass enemy soldiers, bombed out bridges and the fearsome cold of the Alps to get there?&nbsp; And can Nina save her beloved Zelda, too?</p><p>Alison Lester is one of the most popular and best-selling writers and illustrators of children's books in Australia, and has won many awards there.&nbsp; Her career spans over 21 years and includes the Clive Eats Alligators series, The Quicksand P</p><h2>The Collector</h2><p>John Fowles&#39;s classic story of possession, obsession and love.</p><p>John Fowles (1926-2005) was educated at Oxford and subsequently lectured in English at universities in Greece and the UK.

KAHNWEILER, <i>My Galleries and Painters</i>CHAPTER ONE<i>The Atmosphere of Propaganda</i>IA visitor to the studio at 27, rue de Fleurus in the early years of the twentieth century might well have believed he had been admitted to an entirely new form of institution--a ministry of propaganda for modern art. His knock upon the large double door that was secured by the only Yale lock in Paris's sixth <i>arrondissement</i> would have brought his hostess, a stout, impressive woman in her thirties, a woman with an imperturbable expression, a pair of frankly curious brown eyes, and a remarkable air of self-possession. Her customary response, if the visitor was not a familiar member of her circle of friends and acquaintances, would be a lax <i>"De la part de qui venez-vous?"</i> delivered in a contralto voice, the French tinged with a refined American accent.Because anyone was admitted to the weekly at homes at the rue de Fleurus, the question was a mere formality. As likely as not, however, the guest might be forced to stammer, "But by yours, Madame." For Gertrude Stein, the hostess of these Saturday evenings, which combined excited talk with an extraordinary glimpse of the most outrageous modern paintings, was frequently in the habit of meeting interesting people, inviting them to her home--and promptly forgetting that she had.The Yale lock was not for security. Although the whitewashed walls of the studio room were lined with paintings from eye level to the high ceiling--lined, tier upon tier, with stunning C�zanne oils and watercolors, with the brilliant smears of Matisse's Fauve landscapes, with the somber, brooding nudes and acrobats of Picasso's Blue and Rose Period paintings--the pictures had not acquired the astronomical values they were to have in later years. The Yale lock was a concession to Gertrude Stein's ingrained American sense of convenience. She found French keys a nuisance--too large and bothersome. The small key to her Yale lock could be dropped conveniently into her purse when she left the atelier for her usual afternoon walks. Or, it could be slipped into her pocket when she stepped out of the <i>pavillon</i>--the adjacent two-story apartment where she lived with her brother Leo--to open the studio doors for their arriving Saturday-evening guests.The paintings were the principal attraction of the Steins' at homes. In the decade before World War I, few places in Paris could provide a similar glimpse of such modern audacities. For their services in exposing modern art to a continuous stream of international visitors--eager young German students, visiting Swedes and Hungarians, wealthy American tourists--the Steins could easily have claimed the distinction of having instituted the first museum of modern art. Within a few years of their arrival in the French capital, they had put together an astounding collection of everything the tradition-bound Parisian art world considered outrageous and revolutionary--and, more often than not, hoaxes of the most deliberate kind. Among the French it was considered sport to visit the Steins at least once, just to see the incredible trash the two gullible Americans had hung on their walls.Moreover, the Steins themselves were an attraction. Open-minded, hospitable, they were both inveterate and enthusiastic talkers. Leo Stein discoursed on any subject from Picasso's painting style to the latest theories on diet, bringing to his discussion an amazing fund of odd information and queer observations. Gertrude, in those early years beginning to take herself seriously as a writer, was content to leave the aesthetic discussions to her brother Leo. She nonetheless admitted that argument was the very air she breathed. Among the assembled guests and, usually, at the center of a heated discussion, Leo cut an odd figure. He was taller and thinner than Gertrude, and his sharp profile, his straggly reddish beard and slightly balding head gave him a rabbinical appearance. He was a man of intense and antic gestures; in the middle of a conversation he would suddenly sit down and rest his feet on a bookcase, several inches above the level of his head, explaining that this was necessary for his cranky digestion.Gertrude was formidable in appearance. On Saturday evenings her ample body was usually encased in a loose-fitting hostess gown. She looked monumental; the rounded, firm volumes of her head, her massivebody seemed as if carved from stone. Even those who disliked her were struck by Gertrude's impressive bearing. Seated in one of the high-backed Renaissance chairs in the studio, her legs tucked under her Buddha-like, she gave the impression of an irresistible force disguised as an immovable object.Dressed in brother-and-sister outfits of practical brown corduroy and wearing comfortable but unconventional sandals, the Steins were familiar figures on the streets of Paris and in the city's art galleries. On many occasions, they could be found in the tiny bric-a-brac shop where Mademoiselle Berthe Weill showed young and undiscovered artists, or in the little gallery on the rue Lafitte run by the ex-clown Clovis Sagot. More often they could be seen in another rue Lafitte establishment, picking their way through the disorderly stacks of canvases in the gallery run by the wily and unctuous Ambroise Vollard. Vollard, it was rumored, kept his better things hidden away in back rooms, waiting for prices to rise--among them a superb cache of C�zanne paintings he had been shrewd enough to acquire before the artist died. If one found a painting and took it to him to ask the price, the dealer was apt to put on a look of surprise, then baldly state that he had sold that picture just last month but had been unable to find it--meanwhile hurrying the canvas out of sight.But Vollard sold regularly to the Steins, whom he professed to like. The Steins, he maintained, were less disposed to haggle over the price of a picture than were his richer clients. And the Steins paid promptly. As Vollard once confided to Leo, the rich paid only when they happened to think about it; their thoughts mostly ran to other matters. Among the patrons of the Parisian caf�s, the Steins were considered to be wealthy American eccentrics. Leo, in fact, was referred to as an American Maecenas. But boulevard appraisals carried little weight with Vollard. He made it his business to know the precise financial situations of his customers. He had learned that the Steins' modest but comfortable income from San Francisco properties did not place them in the same category as his millionaire clients, such as the H. O. Have-meyers and Charles Loeser, who also bought C�zannes. But Vollard maintained that he liked dealing with Leo and his sister. They were the only clients, he said, who bought pictures "not because they were rich, but despite the fact that they weren't."Gertrude and Leo Stein were not the only members of the family addicted to modern art. Their elder brother Michael and his wife, Sarah, were avid collectors, too. The Michael Steins maintained an apartment on the nearby rue Madame, having moved there from San Francisco with their young son Allan shortly after Leo and Gertrude had settled in Paris in 1903. Its walls were also studded with modern paintings, most of them handsome early works by Matisse. Michael Stein--a paunchy, dapper man with fastidiously trimmed mustache andbeard--was the conservative, business-minded member of the family. With hard work and the shrewd sale of his father's railroad interests, Michael had turned the family holdings to sufficient account to endow each member with a comfortable income. It was Michael who kept a watchful eye on Gertrude and Leo's joint finances, cautioning them about their overdrawn accounts, advising fiscal responsibility. But it was Michael who advanced the necessary sums when Leo and Gertrude found themselves lacking the funds to buy a particularly tempting pair of Gauguins. His wife, Sarah--Sally to her friends--was a sweet, motherly-looking woman. An aspiring artist, she was one of the first and most dedicated students in the painting classes that Matisse conducted early in his career.Disgruntled conservative artists whose works never entered the Stein collections referred to the family as the "Stein Corporation," as if it were an aesthetic cartel. Among such artists there was speculation as to whether the Steins bought their peculiar paintings because they liked them or whether they liked them because they had bought them. So familiar was the association of the Steins with everything radical in Parisian art that French art critics--horrified by the so-called infantile smears of Matisse's paintings and casting about for explanations-claimed that such work was clearly intended only for gullible and benighted Americans. The French, quite obviously, were not to be taken in by the crude hoaxes hanging on the walls of an upstart American salon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The marvel was that the studio room at 27, rue de Fleurus--large by ordinary domestic standards but small for such a public function--should have held so many paintings, so many people. The Steins had set about collecting so industriously that the three available walls of the studio--the fourth was cut by the double door and oddly shaped windows that let in the northern light--were crammed with pictures hung row above row. In the dim and fluttering gaslight, only the lower ranges of art were clearly visible. Visitors had to shade their eyes from the glare of the low-hanging fixtures in order to pierce the gloom in which many of the pictures hung tantalizingly above.But, even at the lower levels, there was enough to take in. Closely packed along one wall were a row of C�zanne watercolors, their exacting brushstrokes sketching out woodland glades and the rising fronts of austere mountains. Above them the brilliant fireworks of Matisse's Fauve pictures jostled Picasso's sober green-and-tan Spanish landscapes --pictures that carried in them the first hints of Cubist rectitude. A huge Picasso of a nude youth leading a horse, a painting from the artist's Rose Period, crowned the space above a cumbersome Henri IVbuffet. Across the room the Picasso's scale was more than matched by Matisse's pastorale <i>Joy of Life</i>, a landscape idyll of frenziedly dancing figures and entwined nudes. On another wall a nude by Felix Vallotton --an attempt by a lesser man to recapture the shock of Manet's famous <i>Olympia</i>--sprawled out clinically on a crisp white sheet. Her quixotic expression and relaxed arm seemed to call attention to the small, precious Maurice Denis of a nursing mother and child hanging directly below it.The pictures seemed like a seraglio--viewed in the modern manner. Nudes proliferated everywhere: in the awkward nakedness of C�zanne's <i>Bathers</i>, in the amiable roughhousing of Renoir's plump and gamboling females, in a Bonnard girl lying in suggestive exhaustion on a rumpled bed. There was Picasso's nude nymphet, wise beyond her years, holding a basket of flowers. It was this frankness of subject matter, this unembarrassed display of the Steins' sensual tastes, as much as the audacity of the painting styles that produced the expected shock for visitors who had come to be astounded.The room was a jumble of furniture as well, crowding guests into a sense of intimacy. A long, sturdy Florentine table surrounded by Renaissance chairs was drawn close to the cast-iron stove at the back of the room. There were sideboards and buffets and bulky chests and little tables settled along walls and in corners. Each supported its full weight of accumulated objects: bronze Buddhas and fragments of bas-reliefs, a plaster head by Picasso, a coy modern Venus by Elie Nadelman, Matisse's early bronze <i>The Slave</i>. There were cheap porcelain figurines, costly Renaissance plates, tiny alabaster urns with alabaster doves balancing at the rims--objects Gertrude bought when she visited curio shops. Leaning against the walls were large portfolios of Japanese prints and Picasso drawings.In time, the art burst out of the confines of this public room and was given refuge in the adjacent pavilion. There, Picasso and Matisse drawings were tacked to the double doors that led to the cramped dining room. In the dining room itself there were no pictures. The walls were lined with Gertrude and Leo's collection of books: college texts, books on psychology, philosophy, and history (Leo's amorphous territory); assorted volumes of English and American writers--cheap and expensive editions alike of Shakespeare, Trollope, and the English poets (Gertrude's special interest). But there were other spaces in the pavilion that could accommodate the overflow of their expanding art collection. Paintings that could not sustain their impact amid the exacting standards of the studio were transferred to Leo's small ground-floor study, which came to be known as the <i>salon des refus�s</i>. Or they were lodged in the second-floor bedrooms. In one of these, Gertrude hung on the ceiling above her bed the testimonial of her enduring friendship with Picasso, the painter's little <i>Homage to Gertrude</i>--a picture atonce intimate and extravagant in its pleasures, the canvas crowded with big-breasted angels accompanying a woman modestly bearing a plate of fruit.IIIf there had been such a thing as an international conspiracy to promote modern art in the early years of this century, 27, rue de Fleurus would have been close to the heart of it. "The place was charged with the atmosphere of propaganda," Leo remembered. The Steins, however, did not have sole custody of the modern movement. Many of the guests who crowded their Saturday evenings had come to the new art on their own. But the Steins had so placed themselves at the center of the network of journalists, publicists, advocates, and collectors who were spreading the gospel of modernism that, sooner or later, anyone interested in modern art would find his way to the rue de Fleurus. There he could assure himself of the continuing vitality of Matisse's and Picasso's stylistic ventures, and catch up with the latest cultural gossip.Among the guests at 27, rue de Fleurus, there was an improbable mixture of types and nationalities: impoverished art students and wealthy collectors, ardent Swedish followers of the moderne, gregarious Americans looking for fun, irritating Germans who wanted to be shown things that had been placed out of reach. It did not escape Gertrude's attention that there was an unusually constant flow of Hungarians. She accounted for it as best she could. "It happened," she said, "that some hungarian had once been brought and the word had spread from him throughout all Hungary, any village where there was a young man who had ambitions heard of 27 rue de Fleurus and then he lived but to get there and a great many did get there ... , all sizes and shapes, all degrees of wealth and poverty, some very charming, some simply rough and every now and then a very beautiful young peasant."Inevitably, the tourists came because it was the thing to do when one was in Paris. A few went away converted, spreading the gospel of modernism among the heathen, sending fresh troops for later visits. Others came to scoff at the pictures, barely able to conceal their laughter before the doors closed behind them. Some came purposely to bait the artists. For on Saturday evenings, the perpetrators of thes...</p><h2>The Great Coalfield War</h2><p>The classic study of one of America's most violent labor struggles.<p>"The effect of this work is simply enraging, for the reality that the documentation evokes, both of wickedness and of the suffering that wickedness caused, is intolerable". -- The New Yorker</p></p><p>It was the most violent and highly significant battle of organized labor in the United States. That lengthy struggle in Ludlow, Colorado, pitted thousands of immigrant miners - largely from Eastern Europe - against absentee company operators who controlled the coal mines of southern Colorado in the early twentieth century. The largest coal company was the Pueblo-based Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., as its chief director. Now in paperback, The Great Coalfield War is the most complete and carefully documented account of the more-than-year-long strike by the United Mineworkers&#39; Union to gain recognition from stubborn anti-union operators who were joined by political, judicial, media, law enforcement, and other powerful interests in the Colorado industrial establishment. The bravery, hardship, and deaths suffered by the miners and their families moved millions of Americans to unprecedented sympathy for the efforts of organized labor and led President Wilson to order federal troops to restore law and order. Though action shifted to Washington and a congressional investigation, it would take years before Colorado&#39;s coal miners gained union protection.George S McGovern, former US senator from South Dakota, was the Democratic party candidate in the 1972 presidential election.

Knappe, one of the Third Reich's best and brightest, trained under Rommel and distinguished himself rapidly, meeting the F hrer as a young peacetime soldier. He lived and fought through most of the major campaigns (France, Russia, Italy, the defense of Berlin), cheating death time after time, surviving for nearly five years as a Russian prisoner. Here, aided by Brusaw (The Business Writer's Handbook--not reviewed), Knappe offers precise, affecting memories of the WW II era--of his family, his circle, and a Jewish friend who had to leave Germany; of the way people lived in different places he was billeted, and of the textures of his life: the Russian winter and the hell of combat are palpable. No everyman, Knappe comes off as sensitive as well as dutiful, and remorseless in his respect for his own life. Yet the self-deceptions of nationalism and war appear in justifying asides here and there. He was bothered by the use of children in the war, he tells us, but outraged when a teenaged leader failed to report that they had fled their position, and he was nonplussed by a Russian woman who thought Fascism would be as bad as Communism. His memoir displays an unnerving acceptance of an establishment: There is no hint of civil disobedience. Knappe was disturbed about the treatment of Jews and wondered, ``Why invade Russian when we have a treaty?''- -but his ethic of discipline did not allow him the initiative of those who plotted to kill Hitler. Withal, a superb description of the German war machine from creation to defeat, and a fine, absorbing chronicle of a remarkable time.

Way off. I was tingling in places I shouldn't be tingling, and remembering our one-night stand two months ago.<br><br><em>I should be remembering what happened after. The serial killer who damn near offed us both.</em><br><br>Mason Brown moved his oughtta-be-illegal bod around in front of me so I couldn't not look at him. I knew he knew that. "I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that. Should have started with hello. You look great, Rachel. Really great."<br><br>"It's the makeup. They overdo it for TV."<br><br>"It's not the makeup." He tried his killer smile on me. A fucking saint would steam up at those dimples. "I've missed you. What's it been, a month?"<br><br><em>Three weeks since I've seen him. Thanksgiving. Two months, nineteen days and around twenty hours since we 'd had sex, last time I checked, but I'll be damned if I'll say that out loud.</em> "Something like that."<br><br>"Too long, any way you count it."<br><br>"We agreed that <em>we</em>&#x2014;" I waved my hand between us "&#x2014;would be a bad idea."<br><br>"Yeah, but I thought that meant we wouldn't date." <em>And by</em> date <em>he meant</em> screw. "Not that we wouldn't ever see each other again."<br><br>Except that seeing him made me want to jump his bones. Hence the not-seeing-each-other part. But I couldn't tell him <em>that,</em> either.<br><br>"Look, Mason, I have five minutes before I have to be on that stage, in front of a live studio audience, hawking my new book, and you're really throwing me off my Zen."<br><br>"You have Zen?"<br><br>I closed my eyes. "No, but I fake it beautifully when I'm not. " <em>Don't finish that sentence.</em> "What makes you think I'd be any help, anyway? I only connected with the Wraith because he had your brother's heart, along with his penchant for murder, and I have your brother's eyes, and we connected in some woo-woo way I'm still not sure I believe. It was a fluke, and it's over. I'm no crime fighter."<br><br>He put both hands on my shoulders. <em>Yeah, that's right, touch me and make it even harder for me not to rip your shirt off, you clever SOB.</em> "Just give me a chance to tell you about the case. Come on, please?"<br><br>I closed my eyes, sighed hard and dropped my head to one side. When I opened my eyes again, he was flashing those damned dimples. He knew he had me. Hell, he'd had me at hello. The bastard.<br><br>"Buy me lunch after I finish up here and I'll let you bend my ear, but that's it, Mason."<br><br>The door opened. "Two minutes, Ms. de Luca," said the curly head that poked through.<br><br>I nodded and looked at Mason. His hands were still on my shoulders, and his smile had faded into an "I want to kiss your face off" sort of look.<br><br>I licked my lips, then wished I hadn't. I reminded myself of all the reasons we'd decided not to "date." I'd been blind for twenty years. Now I wanted to live my life as a sighted adult for a while before sharing it with anyone else. That made sense, didn't it?<br><br>I couldn't look at him. "I've gotta go."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Fine." I turned away from him and tried to school my face into that of a spiritually enlightened guru who could change every viewer's life for a mere $17.99 in hardcover or $22.99 for the audiobook, plus tax where applicable. Only a fool would wait for the paperback or ebook versions, though they would be cheaper.<br><br>Mason sighed. Maybe in disappointment that I didn't seem as glad to see him as he'd seemed to see me. A lot he knew. My inner idiot was doing cartwheels.<br><br>The door opened again. Polly-Production-Assistant came all the way in this time. "Ready?"<br><br>"Sure am." <em>Not even close.</em><br><br>She took my arm and led me out the door and through a maze of hallways. Mason was following right along behind us.<br><br>I turned to shoot him down over my shoulder. "I thought you were gonna wait in the greenroom?"<br><br>"I want to watch the taping. That's all right, isn't it?"<br><br>"Oh, sure, it's fine," said Polly or whatever the hell her real name was. "We're in a commercial break, on in thirty seconds."<br><br>She dragged me through a set of big double doors, and then we high-stepped over masses of writhing cables onto the set, stopping along the way so someone could run a mike up my back, under my dressy black jacket, over my shoulder and clip it to my flouncy lapel.<br><br>"Say something."<br><br>"Mike check," I said, looking through the window to where the sound guys wore headsets suitable for a firing range. "How's it sound?"<br><br>They gave me unanimous thumbs-up, and I headed for the sofa. The show's host, failed comedienne Mindy Becker, got up to shake my hand, then I sat down in the most flattering manner, uncomfortably on the edge of the sofa, legs crossed at the ankles, one hand resting lightly atop the other on my thigh. I wet my lips and plastered a great big smile on my face. I tried with everything in me to forget that Detective Mason Brown was standing a few yards away, watching my every move and hopefully wanting me as much as I was wanting him. He'd better be.<br><br>He knew my deepest secret, too, I thought. The secret only those closest to me knew. That I didn't really believe in what I wrote. That I was a skeptic, feeding the gullible a steady diet of what they most wanted to hear&#x2014;that the power to change their lives was in their hands&#x2014;and laughing all the way to the bank.<br><br>And then the director said, "In three, two.. " and pointed a finger at us.<br><br>"We're back!" Mindy told the camera. "Joining us now is the bestselling author of <em>Wish Yourself Rich,</em> the book that's sweeping the nation and changing lives, while spending its fifth week on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. After going blind at the age of twelve, Rachel de Luca, the author who's been teaching us how to make our own miracles for five years now, experienced one of her own when her eyesight was restored by a cornea transplant this past August." She swung her head my way. "Welcome to the show, Rachel. I'm so glad to have you."<br><br>"Thanks, Mindy. It's great to be here."<br><br>"I want you to know that I have read this..." Mindy picked up a copy from the arm of her chair. "...this <em>gem,"</em> she said, "from cover to cover, and I loved it so much I got copies for every single member of today's studio audience as an early Christmas present."<br><br>Applause, applause.<br><br>"I can't tell you how deeply this book touched me."<br><br>"Thanks, and thanks for saying that."<br><br>"While the title is <em>Wish Yourself Rich,</em> this book is about so much more. About creating our own experiences, and actually having the lives we dream of. A lot of spiritual leaders today are saying many of the same things that you say in these pages, but, Rachel, you are the only one who is living, breathing, undeniable proof that it's true."<br><br>More applause.<br><br>"Why don't we start at the beginning? You went blind at the age of twelve."<br><br>I nodded. "It was a gradual process, but yes, eventually, I woke up one morning completely unable to see."<br><br>"What was the last thing you remember seeing?" <em>Oh, good question.</em> "It was my brother Tommy's face."<br><br>She made a sympathetic sound. "This is the brother you lost earlier this year?"<br><br>"Yes, just before I got my transplant. He was the victim of a serial killer."<br><br>She set the book on her lap and, frowning, put her hands over mine. "How do you manage to have something like that happen and not let it rock your faith? You are so positive, so certain that we create what we focus on. How did you come to terms with your brother's murder?"<br><br>It was not the first time I'd had this question. Thankfully, I was prepared for it. I wrote this crap for a living, after all. "Tommy's journey was his own. I can't know what his higher self intended for him, or why his life had to end the way it did. I only know that I have two choices. I can be at peace with knowing that <em>he</em> is at peace, trusting that everything happens for a reason and that I will know what those reasons are when my own time comes to cross to the other side, or I can wallow in misery and ask 'why me' and 'why him' and resent the universe for being so cruel. My brother is going to be just as dead, either way."<br><br>"That is so <em>deep,"</em> Mindy said, shaking her head slowly. <em>"So</em> deep."<br><br>"We get hung up when we think our happiness is dependent on circumstances outside ourselves. I'd be happy if only this would happen, we say, or if only that hadn't happened. We have to let go of that and realize that happiness is a choice. When we can choose to be happy <em>in spite</em> of what's going on outside us rather than <em>because</em> of it, when we can stop letting circumstances dictate how we feel, <em>that</em> is true empowerment."<br><br>"That's amazing. 'Happiness is a choice.' That's so good."<br><br>I smiled humbly. It really was one of my best nuggets of manure, that one. I rearranged this particular piece of...wisdom slightly after every interview, so it sounded fresh. Hell, I knew a thousand ways to say it by now. It was the core message of seven bestsellers.<br><br>" So did you always know you would get your eyesight back one day?"<br><br>"Not at all," I said. "In fact, I'd pretty much given up on it. I'd had cornea transplants before, but I was one of those rare individuals who rejected them every time. And I rejected them violently. My doctor had to convince me that it was worth trying again with a new procedure." That, at least, was true.<br><br>"And it worked." Mindy clapped her hands to emphasize the words. "What was the first thing you saw after the bandages came off?"<br><br>"My sister's face," I said, again speaking the truth.<br><br>"Oh, that's beautiful," Mindy said in an emotional falsetto, blinking rapidly.<br><br>"So is she."<br><br>Applause, applause.<br><br><em>Note to self, use that line again.</em><br><br>"So if we create our own experiences according to where we put our focus, how do you think you attracted your blindness?"<br><br><em>Because life sometimes sucks, and I drew the short straw. Because bad shit happens, and it doesn't make any sense at all and it never will.</em><br><br>I nodded sagely while I pulled the appropriate well-rehearsed reply from my archives. I had them for all the tough questions. "Until we know that our thoughts and focus create our lives," I said, "we sort of create by default. Our higher selves guide us toward the life we're supposed to lead, and we either go with the flow or fight tooth and nail. I believe this was simply a part of my journey in this lifetime. I think I had agreed to it before I ever incarnated."<br><br>"Really?" she said. "You <em>really</em> think all those years of blindness happened to you for a reason?"<br><br>"Absolutely." <em>Because I had shitty luck.</em><br><br>"And have you reached any conclusions about what that reason might have been?"<br><br>"I think I've pieced together some of it, but not all. I don't think I'll know all of it until I'm on the other side, looking back, reviewing my life and the lessons it taught me. But I do know that being blind led me to my career of writing self-help <em>(bullshit)</em> books like the ones my family used to <em>(push on me)</em> get for me when I was going through hard times. It led me to dear friends I might not have made otherwise, people in my transplant support group, the best friend I ever had in my life, Mott Killian, who's since passed over himself, and my dog, of course."<br><br><em>And Mason Brown. It led me to him. When he hit me with his car because I stormed into a crosswalk, blind as a bat and too mad to be careful. Helluva coincidence that he ended up donating his brother 's corneas to me later that same day. Helluva coincidence.</em><br><br>A big smile split Mindy's face, and she lifted the book again, opened the back cover and turned it toward the camera, which caught a close-up of Myrtle sitting in the passenger seat of my precious inspiration-yellow T-Bird with the top down, wearing her goggles and yellow scarf, and "smiling" at the camera as only a bulldog could do, bottom teeth sticking up over her upper lip.<br><br>The audience laughed, then applauded again.<br><br>"Myrtle is blind, too," I said. "I might not have taken in a blind old dog if I hadn't been through what I had." Odd, that was sappy as hell, and yet it was the absolute truth. Just like the bit I'd been thinking about the way Mason and I met. I should really be using this stuff more. But it made me uncomfortable to point to true things in order to prove my false claims. Muddied the waters. I liked clear lines between real life and my fictional nonfiction.<br><br>"That's beautiful," Mindy said. "That's just beautiful. Thank you so much, Rachel. It's been a pleasure having you. I hope you'll come back."<br><br>"Thank you, Mindy. I'd love to."<br><br>She faced the camera again, holding up the book. "Grab a copy of Rachel de Luca's <em>Wish Yourself</em><br><br><em>Rich,</em> available now in hardcover and audio wherever books are sold."<br><br>Applause, applause, applause.<br><br>"And we're clear!" called the director.<br><br>I relaxed and automatically turned to see if Mason was still there.<br><br>He was. But he was looking at me with his head tipped slightly to one side, like Myrtle when I say the word <em>food.</em> Or the word <em>eat</em> or the word <em>hungry</em> or any word remotely related to a meal.<br><br>He'd just seen a Rachel de Luca he'd probably never met before. The public one. And now he was going to berate me for it throughout an entire lunch. <em>This should be pleasant. Not.</em><br><br></p><h2>If Only He Knew: Understanding Your Wife</h2><p>A how-to book for men that seeks to clarify distinctions between the sexes with a view toward building a stronger marital relationship with this understanding.</p><p>Do you want your wife to: - understand you? - appreciate you? - be more responsive sexually? - support you during hard times? - admire you? - share your interests? - listen to what you have to say?<p>Gary Smalley was one of the country's best-known authors and speakers on family relationships.
